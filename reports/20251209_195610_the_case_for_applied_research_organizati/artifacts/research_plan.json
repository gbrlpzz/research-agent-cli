  "sub_questions": [
    "How do AROs effectively mitigate the 'Valley of Death' inherent in technology transfer compared to traditional university tech-transfer offices?",
    "In what ways do the incentive structures of AROs (e.g., impact-driven vs. publication-driven) differ from academia and corporate R&D?",
    "What role does 'Pasteur\u2019s Quadrant' (use-inspired basic research) play in the strategic mandate of successful AROs?",
    "What are the primary funding mechanisms and sustainability models for independent applied research institutes?",
    "How do emerging models like Focused Research Organizations (FROs) evolve the traditional ARO framework?"
