  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Government funding supports industry-academia research and innovation projects in Norway, sharing the risk of the research component in innovation. However, funding alone may not be sufficient to overcome potential differences in collaborative agendas and ways of working. As a result, positive research outcomes often get stuck in the <jats:italic>valley of death</jats:italic>, instead of ending up as successful innovations that create value. To contribute to bridging the <jats:italic>valley of death</jats:italic>, we investigated the importance of six agile principles for collaborative industry-academia research and innovation projects, abbreviated IPN in Norway. The study was limited to the manufacturing sector. We surveyed 124 IPN project leaders (70 from industry; 54 from academia) to evaluate the importance of the knowledge management practices associated with the six agile principles across the three project stages. The statistical analyses indicate the consistency of the agile principles throughout the project stages. This means that agile principles are relevant for IPN projects and can be used as guidelines for improvement of the knowledge management practices. Moreover, the study identifies the agile principles that are perceived as most important to use in different stages of a project. It also identifies the different perceptions of the importance of agile principles of the project leaders from industry and academia. These findings can support project leaders who are implementing agile principles to industry-academia research and innovation projects. The results from the study can also support national and federal research/innovation councils in decision-making when assessing industrial research applications.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Research and technology organizations (RTOs) are studied in the innovation policy literature mainly as providers of R\&amp;D services and as intermediaries between universities and the private sector. Through the case of the Institut National d’Optique (INO), Canada’s leading RTO in the optics and photonics industry, we argue that RTOs can also act as entrepreneurs by generating technologies and commercializing them through licensing, technology transfers and spin-offs. By analyzing the broad range of activities undertaken by INO, we also discuss what characteristics make some RTOs more likely to embrace entrepreneurship than others. Those characteristics include the following: renewed access to government funding to build a strong in-house research infrastructure and scientific workforce; strategic R\&amp;D planning that incorporates commercial objectives and an environment that encourages a culture of entrepreneurship among employees; the ability to act as the driving force of a network of academic, government and private sector organizations. From a policy perspective, the INO case indicates that the main value of using RTOs as entrepreneurship instruments does not lie in profitability but rather in developing dynamic regional systems of innovation.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>There has been a sea change in the scientific world, advanced even more rapidly by the recent compounded public crises. Accelerated discovery, and impact from such discoveries have come from convergence approaches across disciplines, sectors, institutions, and the multiple communities seeking the common goal of innovations that transform. The classic simultaneous pursuit of fundamental understanding and application has been termed  Pasteur\textquotesingle s quadrant, where use-inspired basic research occurs. In the classic schematic developed by Donald Stokes, three quadrants  represent research approaches using a 2D plane in which the vertical dimension represents the quest for understanding (basic research) and the horizontal dimension represents the consideration of use (applied research). The three outer quadrants are Bohr\textquotesingle s (pure basic research), Edison\textquotesingle s (pure applied research), and Pasteur\textquotesingle s (use-inspired  basic research). Viewing each of these axes as a continuum, we label the previously unnamed but contributory cell as the Innominate quadrant, where a nonzero amount of discovery and applied research also has value in generating scientific tools, novel processes or products that inform the other quadrants. More importantly, a reimagined Pasteur\textquotesingle s quadrant schema shows a third dimension of Transformations over Time, occurring through a continuous fluid interchange among the quadrants.  Transformative innovations may originate from any single quadrant.  While work in Pasteur\textquotesingle s quadrant has been shown to be highly productive, a dynamic fluid interchange among the quadrants is often involved and generates transformative advances at a faster rate. This should inform how we fund science, engineering, and medicine and educate the next generation of innovators.</jats:p>},

@article{Pest_science_in_Mangel_2024,
  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>More than 25 years ago, Donald Stokes argued that we must move beyond the false dichotomy of basic or applied research and suggested that when considering a program of scientific research it is important to ask whether (i) the work is motivated by use and (ii) if there is a search for fundamental understanding. Giving yes/no answers to these questions allows us to characterize research more fully, replacing the \textquotedblleft or\textquotedblright  of \textquotedblleft basic or applied\textquotedblright  by a richer understanding of the process of science. Stokes proposed that research that was motivated by a consideration of use and sought fundamental understanding be called research in Pasteur’s Quadrant. One advantage of such work is that the search for fundamental understanding means that the problem-solving tools are more likely to be transferrable. After reviewing Stokes’s formulation of research, I illustrate it with examples from the control of tephritid flies and the use of insect parasitoids for biological control. Thinking about one’s work within Stokes’s framework has many advantages for individual scientists, including guidance for journal selection, how to organize and conclude papers and seminars, and the \textquotedblleft elevator speech.\textquotedblright  Furthermore, since research in Pasteur’s Quadrant has the characteristic of simultaneously increasing our understanding of how the world works and improving applications, it will more likely benefit the community of pest scientists.</jats:p>},
