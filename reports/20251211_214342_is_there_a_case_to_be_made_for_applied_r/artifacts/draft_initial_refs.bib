  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI\textquotesingle s o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model\textquotesingle s thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model\textquotesingle s generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1-32B exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27\% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1-32B with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50\% to 57\% on AIME24.

  abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have long been the dominant architecture in sequence-to-sequence learning. RNNs, however, are inherently sequential models that do not allow parallelization of their computations. Transformers are emerging as a natural alternative to standard RNNs, replacing recurrent computations with a multi-head attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose the SepFormer, a novel RNN-free Transformer-based neural network for speech separation. The SepFormer learns short and long-term dependencies with a multi-scale approach that employs transformers. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the standard WSJ0-2/3mix datasets. It reaches an SI-SNRi of 22.3 dB on WSJ0-2mix and an SI-SNRi of 19.5 dB on WSJ0-3mix. The SepFormer inherits the parallelization advantages of Transformers and achieves a competitive performance even when downsampling the encoded representation by a factor of 8. It is thus significantly faster and it is less memory-demanding than the latest speech separation systems with comparable performance.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Large language models in the form of chatbots very realistically imitate a dialogue as an omniscient interlocutor and therefore have become widespread. But even Google in its Gemini chatbot does not recommend trusting what the chatbot will write and asks to check its answers. In this review, various types of LLM errors such as the curse of inversion, number processing, etc. will be analyzed to identify their causes. Such an analysis led to the conclusion about the common causes of all errors, which is that transformers do not have deep analogy, hierarchy of schemes and selectivity of content taken into account in the inference. But the most important conclusion is that transformers, like other neural networks, are built on the concept of processing the input signal, which creates a strong dependence on superficial noise and irrelevant information that the transformer’s attention layer cannot compensate for. The concept of neural networks was laid down in the 1950s by the idea of F. Rosenblatt’s perceptron and did not take into account the achievements of cognitive psychology that appeared later. According to the constructivist paradigm, the input word (or perception) is only a way to check the correctness of the constructed predictive model for possible situations. This is the cause of the biggest problem of transformers, called hallucinations. And its elimination is possible only by changing the architecture of the neural network, but not by increasing the amount of data in training.</jats:p>},

@article{Neural_Machine_Bahdan_2014,
  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches over the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures has established a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT\textquotesingle 15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3\textquotesingle s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

@article{FlashAttention_Dao_T_2022,
  abstract = {Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15\% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3\textdollar \textbackslash times\textdollar  speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4\textdollar \textbackslash times\textdollar  speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4\% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1\% accuracy).},

@article{Switch_Transfor_Fedus_2021,
  abstract = {In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.},

As a result, positive research outcomes often get stuck in the <jats:italic>valley of death</jats:italic>, instead of ending up as successful innovations that create value. To contribute to bridging the <jats:italic>valley of death</jats:italic>, we investigated the importance of six agile principles for collaborative industry-academia research and innovation projects, abbreviated IPN in Norway. The study was limited to the manufacturing sector. We surveyed 124 IPN project leaders (70 from industry; 54 from academia) to evaluate the importance of the knowledge management practices associated with the six agile principles across the three project stages. The statistical analyses indicate the consistency of the agile principles throughout the project stages. This means that agile principles are relevant for IPN projects and can be used as guidelines for improvement of the knowledge management practices. Moreover, the study identifies the agile principles that are perceived as most important to use in different stages of a project. It also identifies the different perceptions of the importance of agile principles of the project leaders from industry and academia. These findings can support project leaders who are implementing agile principles to industry-academia research and innovation projects. The results from the study can also support national and federal research/innovation councils in decision-making when assessing industrial research applications.</jats:p>},

The elements that create the valley of death leads to research and technology development high risk and poor return on investment for a great many research and development organizations. This leads eventually to avoiding research and technology development all together because the organizations cannot viably manage the outcome of their early‐stage research and development (ESR\&amp;D) efforts. Unfortunately, there are few established frameworks and processes for enabling smooth transitions to avoid failure and manage risk across fundamental research, applied research, development, and productization. Many leaders, program managers, and scientists are unwilling to involve systems engineering because of the perception that systems engineering is heavily process oriented, adds unnecessary costs, and should be applied only to mature technologies. The value of systems engineering as applied to ESR\&amp;D is unclear to these key individuals. The unfortunate result is that systems engineering is not applied to ESR\&amp;D. This article discusses the potential of application of systems engineering to ESR\&amp;D to improve return on investment and decrease risk.</jats:p>},

By analyzing the broad range of activities undertaken by INO, we also discuss what characteristics make some RTOs more likely to embrace entrepreneurship than others. Those characteristics include the following: renewed access to government funding to build a strong in-house research infrastructure and scientific workforce; strategic R\&amp;D planning that incorporates commercial objectives and an environment that encourages a culture of entrepreneurship among employees; the ability to act as the driving force of a network of academic, government and private sector organizations. From a policy perspective, the INO case indicates that the main value of using RTOs as entrepreneurship instruments does not lie in profitability but rather in developing dynamic regional systems of innovation.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>The incorporation of public organizations is implemented by the central and local governments to improve their efficiency, which should enhance their contributions to national and local economies. In Japan, a series of administrative reforms were implemented at the national and local governments since the late 1990s, some of which took the form of the incorporation. Taking an example of the incorporation of technology extension service (TES) providers established by local governments, this study evaluates the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) by applying the difference-in-differences (DID) model to panel data of TES providers for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Kohsetsushi. Unlike the uniform and simultaneous incorporation of national universities, the incorporation of Kohsetsushi is at the discretion of local governments and the timings of incorporation vary. Applying the conventional two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model to panel data with staggered treatments may yield biased ATTs. Following Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021), this study adopted their DID model (CS-DID) to avoid forbidden comparisons between late and early treated units. The ATTs in terms of extension activities are heterogenous and significantly positive for TWFE-DID but statistically insignificant for CS-DID. The sources of heterogenous treatment effects seem to be decline in innovation agglomerations that made localized spillover insignificant and unobservable organizational capabilities of local governments to exploit the incentive system reform for geographically broader spillover.</jats:p>},

Consistent with this, firms produce more research when it is used internally, but less research when it is used by rivals.

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article addresses, conceptually and empirically, the classification of public research organizations (PROs) understood as non-university and non-enterprise research-focused organizations that are public by nature or in which the government has an influence. The construction of archetypes of research performing organizations has been a standard method of analysis, as reflected in the Frascati Manual that guides national statistical offices to delineate the perimeter of the institutional sector of PROs. However, this practice has often overlooked the emergence of new types because traditional approaches to classification tend to characterize previously defined mutually exclusive categories, rather than allow evidence to reveal categories ex-post. This gives rise to a number of concerns related to the scientific validity of the classification of entities in the organizational field of research. The present article discusses conceptual and methodological issues associated with different classificatory strategies. It also presents the empirical results of a taxonomical exploration that allows the identification of categories not determined ex-ante. Our empirical strategy consists in applying clustering techniques on a number of organizational dimensions, chosen based on theoretical grounds and proxied by variables determined by data availability. We implement it on a pilot dataset of 197 research-focused organizations from eight different European countries.</jats:p>},

@article{Public_Research_Loikka_2011,
  abstract = {<jats:p> National innovation systems and policies are confronted by many interrelated factors, including large socio-economic structural problems, globalisation, pressure to provide public research funding and changes in research communities driven by the Mode 2 paradigm. These changes challenge sectoral public research organisations (PROs). The role of universities and other policy organisations in innovation policy has been studied at length but there has been little investigation of PROs, despite their significance in developed and developing economies. This article fills this gap by exploring PROs in Finland, an open, industrialised and export-dependent economy. It draws several conclusions about the current state and future prospects of PROs in Finland. PROs are in transition in terms of their organisational, managerial and funding structures and their role in the internationalising national innovation system. Their rationale, legitimacy and strategies are also changing due to national innovation driven missions and internationalisation strategies. All PROs in Finland now engage in international cooperation. However, despite increasing funding from international sources and the globalisation of many aspects, PROs are still national organisations subject to national policies and governed by national bodies. Finnish PROs need to redefine their strategies at the international and European levels without forgetting their national role. </jats:p>},

To establish adequate guidelines and achieve better outcomes, it is necessary to observe and evaluate current results connected with these aspects. In terms of the complexity of the green transition domains, measuring green transition is still developing. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the approaches that can be used in tracking the green transition as a result of EU cohesion policy implementation and to analyse achievements associated with the green transition. This will be done using desk research, previous studies, documents, evaluation reports and secondary data on the financing under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIFs) in EU member states, with a special emphasis on themes such as the low-carbon economy, climate change adaptation and risk prevention, environment protection and resource efficiency, and network infrastructure in transport and energy. The paper discusses these results in the context of the current challenges faced by the EU in becoming a leader in the green transition and contributes to the evaluation of the EU cohesion policy.</jats:p>},

@article{DEVELOPMENT_OF_None_2024,
  abstract = {<jats:p>The concept of Smart Specialisation (S3) has emerged as a cornerstone of the European Union’s innovation policy, aimed at fostering regional innovation ecosystems. Introduced in 2010, S3 encourages EU regions to identify and invest in areas where they possess unique strengths, thereby enhancing competitiveness through localization, prioritization, and stakeholder engagement. This strategy is rooted in a place-based approach, leveraging local assets and resources to define a limited set of investment priorities. A key element of S3 is the Entrepreneurial Discovery Process (EDP), which facilitates collaboration among local stakeholders\textemdash businesses, research institutions, public authorities, and civil society\textemdash to identify region-specific strengths and weaknesses. This inclusive approach fosters multi-level governance and synergies between public support mechanisms, driving regional competitiveness and innovation.

  The implementation of S3 has significantly transformed regional innovation ecosystems across the EU, promoting the formation of innovation partnerships, including science-business consortia, clusters, and international thematic collaborations. These structures enhance cooperation among enterprises, research organizations, and government bodies, creating dynamic and interconnected innovation environments. Clusters, in particular, play a pivotal role as intermediaries and catalysts, stimulating cross-sectoral innovation, knowledge exchange, and resource sharing.

  The article highlights the integration of S3 with other EU initiatives, such as the Regional Innovation Valleys and the Interregional Innovation Investments Instrument (I3), which aim to bridge innovation gaps between regions. Special attention is given to less developed regions, where these tools focus on building local innovation capacity, creating jobs, and enhancing regional competitiveness through systemic and locally tailored frameworks.

Successful examples of S3 implementation are examined across various European regions, including Finland’s Six City Strategy, Germany’s North Rhine-Westphalia, and Italy’s Lombardy. These cases demonstrate the adaptability of S3 to diverse regional contexts, emphasizing the importance of continuous stakeholder engagement, monitoring, and evaluation. The article also discusses the challenges of ensuring inclusivity across sub-regions and the need for robust governance structures to sustain long-term innovation ecosystems.

  In conclusion, Smart Specialisation has proven to be an effective tool for enhancing regional innovation ecosystems, fostering collaboration, and reducing disparities across the EU. By aligning regional strengths with broader EU strategic priorities, S3 contributes to the overall innovation capacity and economic resilience of Europe.</jats:p>},

This article examines ambitions for territorial cohesion as they have been operationalized through regional development in Wales. We argue that a potential alternative to the failed realization of territorial cohesion lies in the principles of spatial justice. While territorial cohesion has typically emphasized the redistribution of funds to ‘lagging’ regions, spatial justice, as we define it, is premised upon enabling regions to assert their own capacity to act and pursue positive visions of regional futures, consider the implications of space and scale for the achievement of justice, and define well‐being, development and the ‘good life’ in ways that reflect regional priorities. We examine three ways in which recent political discourses and policy mechanisms in Wales resonate with these ideals. We focus on attempts to envision a progressive Welsh future, develop alternative spaces and scales of governance, and redefine and pluralize understandings of progress and well‐being. The article concludes by reflecting on the practical and conceptual implications of rescaling spatial justice to regional contexts.</jats:p>},

@article{Discontent_and_Bernar_2025,
  abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Debates on left‐behind places, rural resentment and spatial disadvantage posit that political discontent stems from perceived inequalities between regions and on the urban/rural interface. The popularity of this argument is fuelled by frequent mapping of electoral results, which very often demonstrates a spatial correspondence between increased Euroscepticism and Populism on the one hand, and rural peripherality, shrinkage, economic and health issues and other forms of social disadvantage on the other. This paper advances the debate by distinguishing between regional attitudinal effects and social mobility effects, proposing an explicitly multidimensional conceptualisation of regional left‐behindness and indicating that regional effects do not act uniformly across different countries. Using European Values Study data, the paper examines how intergenerational educational mobility and distrust of the EU are affected by regional left‐behindness across Europe, finding weak and non‐uniform effects. Whereas EU distrust is more strongly associated with regional growth, low educational mobility is more affected by the poor regional prosperity typical of rural areas. However, the effects vary considerably across individual countries.</jats:p>},

               <jats:p>There has been a sea change in the scientific world, advanced even more rapidly by the recent compounded public crises. Accelerated discovery, and impact from such discoveries have come from convergence approaches across disciplines, sectors, institutions, and the multiple communities seeking the common goal of innovations that transform. The classic simultaneous pursuit of fundamental understanding and application has been termed  Pasteur\textquotesingle s quadrant, where use-inspired basic research occurs. In the classic schematic developed by Donald Stokes, three quadrants  represent research approaches using a 2D plane in which the vertical dimension represents the quest for understanding (basic research) and the horizontal dimension represents the consideration of use (applied research). The three outer quadrants are Bohr\textquotesingle s (pure basic research), Edison\textquotesingle s (pure applied research), and Pasteur\textquotesingle s (use-inspired  basic research). Viewing each of these axes as a continuum, we label the previously unnamed but contributory cell as the Innominate quadrant, where a nonzero amount of discovery and applied research also has value in generating scientific tools, novel processes or products that inform the other quadrants. More importantly, a reimagined Pasteur\textquotesingle s quadrant schema shows a third dimension of Transformations over Time, occurring through a continuous fluid interchange among the quadrants.  Transformative innovations may originate from any single quadrant.  While work in Pasteur\textquotesingle s quadrant has been shown to be highly productive, a dynamic fluid interchange among the quadrants is often involved and generates transformative advances at a faster rate. This should inform how we fund science, engineering, and medicine and educate the next generation of innovators.</jats:p>},

It was established that several different approaches to the identification of rural territories and territorial units were tested during the nearly twenty-year preparatory period (typology based on a 1 km2 grid; typologies at the LAU 2 level, in particular the degree of urbanization, etc.; at the NUTS 3 levels, in particular urban-rural typology, etc.). which were improved and presented in the Methodological manual on territorial typologies. Today, this technique is basic in establishing the common statistical classification of territorial units (NUTS). It is summarized that cohesion policy is aimed at reducing regional disparities and promoting economic and social cohesion, as well as territorial convergence between EU member states, which has been carried out since the founding of the EU in 1957. In 1992, thefourth cohesion policy fund was created - the Cohesion
 Fund (FZ) - to finance projects to improve the state of the environment and transport infrastructure in member states where the GNP per capita is less than 90\% of the EU average. It was revealed that the formation of the Just Transition Fund in 2021, which corresponds to the EU \textquotedblleft green\textquotedblright  transition paradigm, was an addition to the institutional architecture.
It is argued that the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) are the main financial instrument for supporting cohesion policy and include the following components: ERDF (European Regional Development Fund), ESF (European Social Fund), Cohesion Fund (FZ), European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). The ERDF has been identified as the largest component of the ESIF, which focuses on promoting economic and social cohesion by investing in infrastructure, innovation and entrepreneurship. This Fund was found to support projects related to transport, energy, digital infrastructure, research and innovation, and the transition to a low-carbon economy.
It is emphasized that this fund contributes to employment, social integration and development of skills of the population. The peculiarities of the cohesion fund, which provides financial assistance to member countries whose GNI per capita is below a certain threshold level, have been considered. It has been established that this fund supports large-scale infrastructure projects in
the fields of transport, energy and the environment. At the same time, the EAFRD and EMFF funds support rural development and fisheries respectively, contributing to the overall objectives of cohesion policy.
It has been proven that since 2013, the development of multi-year programs for the development of rural areas of the EU countries has been focused on six priorities of sustainable development: promoting the transfer of knowledge and innovations; increasing competitiveness; promoting the organization of the food production chain and risk management; restoration, preservation and development of ecosystems; increasing the efficiency of resource use and transition to a low-carbon economy; promotion of social integration, reduction of poverty and economic development in rural areas.
The European Green Course, which aims to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, is analyzed. As for agriculture and food, the Green Deal envisages measures to increase sustainability in land management, food production and consumption, in particular through measures that will be included in the strategic plans of the common agricultural policy. Activities and practical actions in domestic practice regarding the creation of conditions for the implementation of the European experience regarding the identification of territorial units and the readiness to participate in attracting financial allocations within the framework of current programs based on the implementation of regulatory and legal support and the ability to master the allocated financial funds in full have been determined.
Key words: rural territories, territorial units, cohesion fund, green course, sustainable development priorities, structural funds.</jats:p>},

@article{Between_policy_Jubany_2025,
  abstract = {<ns5:p>Background Long-standing territorial disparities have evolved into novel forms of inequality, exacerbated by a decline in social status and the protection afforded to citizens. Territorial inequality extends beyond economic disparities in income and wealth, encompassing unequal access to fundamental rights and opportunities such as essential services, infrastructure, and education. These disparities pose significant challenges to comprehensive socioeconomic development. This paper is part of a broader research project on \textquotedblleft left-behindness,\textquotedblright  aiming to explore stakeholders\textquotesingle  perceptions of the underlying drivers of territorial inequalities, as well as the governance mechanisms and policy tools aimed at mitigating these issues. Methods The analysis draws on data from 20 focus groups conducted between November and December 2023, involving 98 national, regional and local stakeholders from seven European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Serbia, and Spain. Results The findings reveal a notable disconnect between national-level discourses on territorial inequalities and the priorities of local and regional stakeholders across the seven countries. While territorial disparities are acknowledged within policy frameworks, efforts to address these issues are often impeded by governance challenges, including tensions between centralization and decentralization, fragmented coordination, and insufficient horizontal and vertical cooperation among actors at different levels of government. Conclusions The research underscores the necessity of adopting place-sensitive, context-specific approaches to address territorial inequalities. It highlights the need to address demographic challenges, geographic isolation, and inequitable funding mechanisms, particularly in underserved regions. Aligning policy interventions with the diverse and context-dependent challenges faced by \textquotedblleft left-behind\textquotedblright  areas is essential for the effective mitigation of territorial disparities.</ns5:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>European Community (EC) Horizon-funded projects and Earth Observation-based Consortia aim to create sustainable value for Space, Land, and Oceans. They typically focus on addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many of these projects (e.g. Commercialization and Innovation Actions) have an ambitious challenge to ensure that partners share core competencies to simultaneously achieve technological and commercial success and sustainability after the end of the EC funds. To achieve this ambitious challenge, Horizon projects must have a proper governance model and a systematized process that can manage the existing paradoxical tensions involving numerous European partners and their respective agendas and stakeholders. This article presents the VCW-Value Creation Wheel (Lages in J Bus Res 69: 4849\textendash 4855, 2016), as a framework that has its roots back in 1995 and has been used since 2015 in the context of numerous Space Business, Earth Observation, and European Community (EC) projects, to address complex problems and paradoxical tensions. In this article, we discuss six of these paradoxical tensions that large Horizon Consortia face in commercialization, namely when managing innovation ecosystems, co-creating, taking digitalization, decision-making, tech-transfer, and sustainability actions. We discuss and evaluate how alliance partners could find the optimal balance between (1) cooperation, competition, and coopetition perspectives; (2) financial, environmental, and social value creation; (3) tech-push and market-pull orientations; (4) global and local market solutions; (5) functionality driven and human-centered design (UX/UI); (6) centralized and decentralized online store approaches. We discuss these challenges within the case of the EC H2020 NextLand project answering the call for greening the economy in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We analyze NextLand Online Store, and its Business and Innovation Ecosystem while considering the input of its different stakeholders, such as NextLand’s commercial team, service providers, users, advisors, EC referees, and internal and external stakeholders. Preliminary insights from a twin project in the field of Blue Economy (EC H2020 NextOcean), are also used to support our arguments. Partners, referees, and EC officers should address the tensions mentioned in this article during the referee and approval processes in the pre-grant and post-grant agreement stages. Moreover, we propose using the Value Creation Wheel (VCW) method and the VCW meta-framework as a systematized process that allows us to co-create and manage the innovation ecosystem while engaging all the stakeholders and presenting solutions to address these tensions. The article concludes with theoretical implications and limitations, managerial and public policy implications, and lessons for Horizon Europe, earth observation, remote sensing, and space business projects.</jats:p>},

@article{Cohesion_or_Wid_Pato_2023,
  abstract = {<jats:p>This comprehensive analysis investigates the effectiveness of EU funding in promoting research and innovation across various regions, with a specific focus on the Horizon Europe Programme. In this study, we employed a mixed-quantitative analysis of funding allocation data sourced from the Horizon Europe Dashboard and the Global Innovation Index. We systematically analysed the distribution of Horizon Europe funds from 2021 to 2023 across all EU Member States and their respective NUTS 2 regions, focusing on per capita and per researcher fund allocation. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted to assess the alignment between fund distribution and innovation indicators such as R\&amp;D intensity and innovation outputs.The study also critically examines the EU’s cohesion policy, which is fundamentally designed to reduce regional disparities and promote equal opportunities across all EU regions. Through our analysis, we aim to assess whether the current implementation of the EU’s financial instruments aligns with the overarching goals of cohesion policy, particularly in terms of fostering uniform economic growth and development. This examination is crucial as it highlights the need for the values of cohesion to be more effectively integrated into the criteria systems of directly managed EU funding programs to achieve its intended objectives of regional and territorial cohesion.The study reveals persistent and widening disparities in the distribution of funds, which accentuate regional and national inequalities within the EU. Despite significant financial allocations aimed at fostering innovation, the evidence points to a concentrated benefit in specific regions, particularly those already developed, thereby raising concerns about the equitable promotion of technological advancement and economic growth across less developed areas. The findings underscore the need for a more balanced and strategic approach to funding that ensures all regions can contribute to and benefit from Europe’s innovation landscape. This research contributes crucial insights into the complexities of funding allocation, the challenges of regional disparities, and the potential pathways towards a more inclusive innovation policy within the European Union.</jats:p>},

Such a topic is particularly interesting for the so-called lagging regions, which, notwithstanding noticeable policy interventions, have been unable to significantly improve their innovation performances. Results of this study show that the exploration capacity, the propensity to cooperation, and the endowed competencies of actors belonging to a region could be considered as key aspects in affecting the regional innovation performance. This means that policy-makers should (i) incentivize investments in research and development activities both at the public and private levels; (ii) support public-private partnerships; (iii) enhance national and regional university systems; and (iv) increase the number of researchers employed both in the public and private sectors.

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Scholarly work in economic geography and regional science has recently seen a renewed interest in spatial inequalities, driven significantly by the debate on left-behind places and the resulting geographies of discontent. The plight of left-behind places calls for new place-based policy responses that address the specific challenges of these regions but that at the same time address grand societal challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, or pollution with synthetic chemicals. Despite growing attention among economic geographers and regional scientists to either green or inclusive regional development approaches, how to reconcile environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness in highly challenged left-behind places remains poorly understood. This editorial reflects on and critically discusses the literature on left-behind places and distils unifying conceptual characteristics of left-behindness. We argue that left-behindness is a temporal, relational, multidimensional, discursive, but not deterministic concept. The non-determinism of left-behindness opens up different choices for actors to shape regional futures. Imagining and negotiating these futures involves dealing with difficult potential trade-offs between environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness, some of which are explored by the articles in this special issue.</jats:p>},

@article{The_Mission_Ori_Cappel_2020,
  abstract = {<jats:p>During the times of the COVID-19 pandemic, nations have issued unprecedented border closures around the world, yielding abrupt impacts on the movement of goods and people. This has heavily affected the quality of life in border regions, which are often found to be at a disadvantage when compared to other regions in terms of employment, accessibility, social services and economic growth. Based upon developing threads in the literature concerning the untapped potential for development in border regions, we argue that the Mission-Oriented Approach (MOA) can fit well with the ambitious goal to revitalize those territories in the aftermath of the pandemic. Despite the surge of MOA in discourses on innovation policy, we seek to implement it in a regional development perspective, pursuing both economic and social policy objectives. The authors unravel the policy concept of MOA into three main aspects: (I) address a sound societal challenge; (II) Research \&amp; Development (R\&amp;D) regional agenda embedded in a cross-border regional development vision; (III) mobilizing multiple cross-sectorial projects. Through a desk study analysis, the authors draw insights from selected case studies where these aspects have been implemented to inspire policy intervention in the aftermath of COVID-19. This paper presents the MOA theoretical model, which has potential explanatory power in other cross-border regions.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>More than 25 years ago, Donald Stokes argued that we must move beyond the false dichotomy of basic or applied research and suggested that when considering a program of scientific research it is important to ask whether (i) the work is motivated by use and (ii) if there is a search for fundamental understanding. Giving yes/no answers to these questions allows us to characterize research more fully, replacing the \textquotedblleft or\textquotedblright  of \textquotedblleft basic or applied\textquotedblright  by a richer understanding of the process of science. Stokes proposed that research that was motivated by a consideration of use and sought fundamental understanding be called research in Pasteur’s Quadrant. One advantage of such work is that the search for fundamental understanding means that the problem-solving tools are more likely to be transferrable. After reviewing Stokes’s formulation of research, I illustrate it with examples from the control of tephritid flies and the use of insect parasitoids for biological control. Thinking about one’s work within Stokes’s framework has many advantages for individual scientists, including guidance for journal selection, how to organize and conclude papers and seminars, and the \textquotedblleft elevator speech.\textquotedblright  Furthermore, since research in Pasteur’s Quadrant has the characteristic of simultaneously increasing our understanding of how the world works and improving applications, it will more likely benefit the community of pest scientists.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Rabies is a disease of antiquity and has a history spanning millennia ever since the first interactions between humans and dogs. The alarming fatalities caused by this disease have triggered rabies prevention strategies since the first century BC. There have been numerous attempts over the past 100 years to develop rabies vaccineswith the goal of preventing rabies in both humans and animals. Thepre-Pasteurian vaccinologists, paved the way for the actual history of rabies vaccines with the development of first generation vaccines. Further improvements for less reactive and more immunogenic vaccines have led to the expansion of embryo vaccines, tissue culture vaccines, cell culture vaccines, modified live vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and adjuvanted vaccines. The adventof recombinant technology and reverse genetics have given insight into the rabies viral genome and facilitated genome manipulations, which in turn led to the emergence of next-generation rabies vaccines, such as recombinant vaccines, viral vector vaccines, genetically modified vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. These vaccines were very helpful in overcoming the drawbacks of conventional rabies vaccines with increased immunogenicity and clinical efficacies. The path traversed in the development of rabies vaccines from Pasteur to the modern era vaccines, though, faced numerous challenges;these pioneering works have formed the cornerstone for the generation of thecurrent successful vaccines to prevent rabies. In the future, advancements in the scientific technologies and research focus will definitely lay the path for much more sophisticated vaccine candidates for rabies elimination.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A growing number of economic geography scholars have discussed the spatial dimensions of sustainability transitions (STs), which entail radical changes in socio-technical systems to overcome societal, economic, and ecological problems. This involves innovation processes with a broad range of distinctive actors. Innovation intermediaries, such as universities and research institutes, are needed to support and accelerate the transfer of knowledge. Nevertheless, little is known about the influence of such actors on the configuration of the knowledge bases required for STs. This article presents insights from 14 semi-structured interviews with experts conducted in a regional innovation system (RIS) in East Germany. In cooperation with the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, we investigate four innovation intermediaries in the region of Eberswalde. The analytical framework links the concept of differentiated knowledge bases to small wins. Our results show that, first, in the Eberswalde region, the relevant actors involved in regional knowledge transfer focus predominantly on synthetic knowledge bases, such as experience-based knowledge of local area settings. Second, symbolic knowledge bases are crucial and often prerequisites for intermediary organizations to recombine knowledge bases and support the capability to innovate in regional knowledge transfer. Symbolic knowledge entails the ability to translate scientific findings to a language that can be understood by the various actors in knowledge transfer. Third, changes in organizational structures complement changes in cultural\textendash cognitive and normative institutions to support innovation on a systemic level and foster change processes.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Innovation represents one of the most crucial levers for regional prosperity and sectoral renewal. Additionally, it is applied to address challenges such as a sustainable transition and the battle against climate change. Since innovation is the result of cooperation between different actors with different backgrounds, the topic is increasingly studied from a systemic perspective. Here, not only internal cooperation but also cross-border connections between regions become important. While smart specialisation, a European policy for innovation and cohesion, highlights the role of interregional cooperation, practical manifestations and research on this aspect have remained limited so far. This article addresses this gap by discussing the relevance of interregional cooperation for knowledge creation and presents empirical evidence on cooperation between organisations in different European regions in the field of environmental sustainability. The underlying dataset was constructed from Horizon 2020 (H2020) research projects with Northern Germany as an exemplary set of regions chosen as the core of a social network analysis (SNA). The findings reveal that involvement in interregional projects is concentrated particularly in urban regions and correlates with GDP and population density. On the other hand, also organisations in regions with different structural characteristics are involved in interregional cooperation, and H2020 managed to introduce new cooperation patterns. Finally, the empirical data do not adequately match the regional smart specialisation strategies (S3) which raises questions on updating smart specialisation as a policy.</jats:p>},

At the same time, these are exactly the regions that the European Union is trying to support through several programmes, including Horizon Europe. This paper investigates the participation of organisations from peripheral regions in environmental projects funded by the Horizon Europe programme. To account for the multidimensional nature of regional peripherality, we define peripheral regions from a geographical, innovation and socio-economic perspective. We then analyse the relationship between these dimensions of regional peripherality and the extent to which regions benefit from Horizon environmental innovation projects in terms of participation, amount of funding and position in the overall network of project consortia.</jats:p><jats:p>Our findings show a greater participation in Horizon environmental innovation projects for regions in Southern and Northern Europe, while within-country peripherality is negatively related to participation.

I develop a theoretical model to study the design of incentives for examiners. The model can explain the puzzling compensation scheme in use at the U.S. patent office, where examiners are essentially rewarded for granting patents, as well as the variation in compensation schemes and patent quality across patent offices. It also has implications for the retention of examiners and for administrative patent review.</jats:p>},

This network (a regional innovation system (RIS)) empowers processes of absorptive capacity\textemdash knowledge access, anchoring and diffusion, contributing to regional innovativeness and competitiveness. Absorptive capacity is considered an important object of scientific research. However, there is still a lack of research providing specific tools that are adaptable for assessing the regional absorptive capacity in a small country. Existing differences among countries and even regions inside a small country require adjusted and modified methods and instruments. Consequently, the goal of this research is to present and substantiate the methodological approach of assessing the RIS\textquotesingle s absorptive capacity giving evidence from a smart region (Kaunas County) of a small country (Lithuania). The mixed-method approach of the research (combining qualitative and quantitative research strategies) was used to substantiate the presented methodological approach. A smart region of a small country can be characterized by a denser institutional infrastructure and higher results (outcomes) of innovative activities. Smartness of the region can be understood as a consequence of the higher level of absorptive capacity.</jats:p>},

@article{The_Role_of_Pro_Nilsen_2018,
  abstract = {<jats:p>It is commonly argued in the literature on regional innovation that regions must continuously develop new economic activities to compensate for economic decline. If a region manages to diversify from an existing path, it can sustain long-term economic development. One of the measures taken to increase these types of opportunities and to avoid lock-in is to stimulate a closer relationship and collaboration between universities and industry partners. However, we know little about the formation and investigation of successful university-industry relationships in regions outside metropolitan areas. This paper seeks to fill this research gap by investigating how different dimensions of cognitive, organizational, social and geographical proximity facilitate or hinder innovation processes in collaborations between industry and universities in peripheral regions. We find that social proximity, combined with high organizational proximity, overcomes the barriers presented by low geographical proximity. Social proximity compensates for thin regional structures with few high-tech firms, a lack of knowledge producers and a weak support system. An important policy implication is that stimulating collaboration within areas of expertise possessed by university and industry partners create potential for innovation.</jats:p>},

The purpose of this article is to present the role of scientific and research units in the cooperation network, as well as the possibility of using their innovation potential when conducting EDP.

Drawing on boundary work literature, we analyse the boundary work strategies employed by the lab\textquotesingle s leading researchers to manage such demands as part of a RwL research project. We observe that the managing researchers buffer several types of boundaries in order not to compromise the transdisciplinary nature of the RwL.

We conclude that, to reduce tensions, the managing researchers should acknowledge the presence of boundaries early on in their RwL research project, that is, during its conception phase.</jats:p>},

@article{Ethical_researc_Shanks_2022,
  abstract = {<jats:p> As the prevalence of conflict and fragility continue to rise around the world, research is increasingly heralded as a solution. However, current ethical guidelines for working in areas suffering from institutional and social fragility, insecurity or violent conflict have been heavily critiqued as highly abstract; focussed only on data collection; detached from the realities of academia in the Global South; and potentially extractive. This article seeks to respond to that assessment by spotlighting some of the most prevalent challenges researchers face in the pursuit of ethical working practices. It explores the material and epistemic injustices that often shape and underpin research structures and relationships in these contexts. The paper draws on the authors’ experiences of research in conflict-affected and fragile contexts over the last fifteen years and on workshop discussions with researchers based in fragile and conflict-affected contexts conducted in Amman, Bogot{\'a} and Dhaka in 2019-2020. The paper works from the premise that achieving ethical research in fragile spaces is not dependent solely on activity at the site of research, but also on decisions made across the entire ecosystem of a research project. It therefore interrogates the full research landscape, from funding models, to research design (including research topics, partnerships, methods, participant selection, and researcher positionality), to dissemination plans and ethical gatekeeping. The paper critically reflects on inequities in the processes of knowledge production about conflict and fragility and the key ethical challenges that researchers encounter. It highlights the need for further guidance, support and accountability to ensure ethical research practices. </jats:p>},

@article{Peace_informed_Itiade_2025,
  abstract = {<jats:p>In the aftermath of violent conflict, fragile states face the dual challenge of rebuilding social cohesion and stimulating economic recovery through sustainable development. Traditional development planning models, often emphasizing infrastructure expansion and economic growth, frequently overlook the underlying causes of conflict and fail to prioritize human security. Peace-informed development planning offers a transformative framework by integrating conflict sensitivity, local resilience, and inclusive governance into investment and infrastructure strategies. This approach aligns development priorities with peacebuilding objectives, ensuring that state-building efforts do not unintentionally exacerbate existing tensions or fuel new grievances. At the broader level, peace-informed planning demands a reorientation of donor policies, international frameworks, and national development agendas to account for the dynamic realities of post-conflict societies. It leverages participatory methods and conflict analysis to identify potential triggers of instability, enabling planners to mitigate risks proactively. Infrastructure investments, when designed through a peace-informed lens, become tools for reconciliation\textemdash connecting divided communities, creating equitable access to resources, and fostering trust in public institutions. Narrowing the focus, this paper highlights case studies from countries such as South Sudan, Afghanistan, and Sierra Leone to demonstrate the operationalization of peace-informed strategies. It examines how integrating human security indicators\textemdash such as access to justice, social inclusion, and livelihood restoration\textemdash into planning cycles enhances both short-term stability and long-term resilience. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for governments, development agencies, and NGOs on mainstreaming peace-informed approaches into post-conflict reconstruction frameworks. By aligning infrastructure investment with the principles of conflict sensitivity and human-centered security, peace-informed development planning lays the foundation for enduring peace and inclusive growth in fragile contexts.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Health systems resilience (HSR) research is a rapidly expanding field, in which key concepts are discussed and theoretical frameworks are emerging with vibrant debate. Fragile and conflict-affected settings (FCAS) are contexts exposed to compounding stressors, for which resilience is an important characteristic. However, only limited evidence has been generated in such settings. We conducted a scoping review to: (a) identify the conceptual frameworks of HSR used in the analysis of shocks and stressors in FCAS; (b) describe the representation of different actors involved in health care governance and service provision in these settings; and (c) identify health systems operations as they relate to absorption, adaptation, and transformation in FCAS.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                <jats:p>We used standard, extensive search methods. The search captured studies published between 2006 and January 2022. We included all peer reviewed and grey literature that adopted a HSR lens in the analysis of health responses to crises. Thematic analysis using both inductive and deductive approaches was conducted, adopting frameworks related to resilience characteristics identified by Kruk et al., and the resilience capacities described by Blanchet et al.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Thirty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria. The governance-centred, capacity-oriented framework for HSR emerged as the most frequently used lens of analysis to describe the health responses to conflict and chronic violence specifically. Most studies focused on public health systems’ resilience analysis, while the private health sector is only examined in complementarity with the former. Communities are minimally represented, despite their widely acknowledged role in supporting HSR. The documentation of operations enacting HSR in FCAS is focused on absorption and adaptation, while transformation is seldom described. Absorptive, adaptive, and transformative interventions are described across seven different domains: safety and security, society, health system governance, stocks and supplies, built environment, health care workforce, and health care services.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Our review findings suggest that the governance-centred framework can be useful to better understand HSR in FCAS. Future HSR research should document adaptive and transformative strategies that advance HSR, particularly in relation to actions intended to promote the safety and security of health systems, the built environment for health, and the adoption of a social justice lens.</jats:p>

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
<jats:p>Agrifood value chains (AVCs) play crucial roles in food security in fragile and conflict-affected economies where there are widespread challenges and disruptions to business operations, food access, and incomes. Yet, given these challenges, safe data collection is challenging in conflict-affected settings and, as a result, the evidence on the disruptions AVC businesses face is thin. In this paper, we rely on novel panel data from AVC businesses in Myanmar, one of 7 countries in the world with extreme conflict. This short paper documents the disruptions experienced by businesses at several levels of the food supply chain, including farmers, input retailers, crop traders, rice millers, and food vendors. We also provide evidence on the implications for prices by analyzing price changes over this period: farm input and sales prices using farm survey data, food retail using data from food vendors, and dietary cost estimates combining consumption and price data. Our results highlight vulnerabilities in food supply chains in fragile and conflict-affected settings. Potential opportunities to strengthen food supply chains in such settings include ensuring access to banking and financial services; minimizing transportation disruptions to mitigate widening gaps between producer and consumer prices; and maintaining access to fuel and electricity as well as cellphone internet networks. Efforts to support these areas could stabilize food availability and reduce food prices, while also increasing farm-gate shares of food prices thereby supporting rural incomes.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p> Purpose: This systematic review investigates the methodological and ethical implications of using remote data collection tools to measure sexual/reproductive health (SRH) and gender-based violence (GBV) outcomes among women and girls in humanitarian and fragile settings. Methods: We included empirical studies of all design types that collected any self-reported primary data related to SRH/GBV using information and communication technology, in the absence of in-person interactions, from women and girls in humanitarian and fragile settings. The search was run in March 2021 without filters or limits in Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov , and Scopus. Quality was assessed using an adapted version of the MMAT tool. Two reviewers independently determined whether each full text source met the eligibility criteria, and conflicts were resolved through consensus. A-priori extraction fields concerned methodological rigor and ethical considerations. Results: 21 total studies were included. The majority of studies were quantitative descriptive, aiming to ascertain prevalence. Telephone interviews, online surveys, and mobile applications, SMS surveys, and online discussion forums were used as remote data collection tools. Key methodological considerations included the overuse of non-probability samples, lack of a defined sampling frame, the introduction of bias by making eligibility contingent on owning/accessing technology, and the lack of qualitative probing. Ethical consideration pertained to including persons with low literacy, participant safety, use of referral services, and the gender digital divide. Conclusion: Findings are intended to guide SRH/GBV researchers and academics in critically assessing methodological and ethical implications of using remote data collection tools to measure SRH and GBV in humanitarian and fragile settings. </jats:p>},

For research to be taken up and incorporated in policy frameworks, knowledge brokering is essential. Scaling of research for development findings will happen through other impact pathways as well, such as development of business models with the private sector, but development and implementation of robust and coherent policies informed by credible evidence is necessary for institutionalizing the work of agriculture and food systems research. Such policies are needed at multiple levels, and knowledge brokers are needed at these different levels as well. Examples of the importance of knowledge brokers in agricultural research for development from the livestock sector and its interaction with the climate change arena are used to illustrate this call for more attention to knowledge brokering.</jats:p>},

@article{The_ethics_of_e_Krause_2021,
  abstract = {<jats:p> This article examines the ethics of using ethnographic methods in contemporary conflict zones. Ethnographic research is an embodied research practice of immersion within a field site whereby researchers use ethnographic sensibility to study how people make sense of their world. Feminist, conflict and peacebuilding scholars who research vulnerable populations and local dynamics especially value ethnographic approaches for their emphasis on contextual understanding, human agency, egalitarian research relationships and researcher empathy. While immersion leads to knowledge that can hardly be replaced by using more formal approaches, it also elicits ethical dilemmas. These arise not only from the specific research context but also from who the researcher is and how they may navigate violent and often misogynous settings. I argue that many dilemmas may and perhaps should not be overcome by researcher skill and perseverance. Instead, ethical challenges may lead researchers to adopt limited and/or uneven immersion in their field site, not as failed or flawed ethnography but as an ethical research strategy that incorporates ethnographic sensibility to a varying extent. Examining why researchers may opt for limited and uneven immersion is important because in conflict research, stereotypes of the intrepid (male) researcher with a neutral gaze still tend to mute open discussions of how gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, class and other background factors inevitably shape immersion. This article seeks to contribute to creating discursive space for these conversations, which are vital for researchers to analyse, reflect and write from the position of a ‘vulnerable observer’ and incorporate greater transparency in the discussion of research findings. </jats:p>},

@article{The_Challenges_Suzana_2021,
  abstract = {<jats:p>Malaysia’s economic transformation towards the status of a high income nation has led to the widespread demand for an accelerated corporatization policy; one where public sector agencies are transformed into business entities to facilitate the creation of knowledge and wealth. This shift was encouraged by successful corporatization models abroad, including those adopted by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in Germany; the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in Korea; and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States. These institutions have since encouraged a similar corporatization process in emerging and third world nations. However, corporatization comes along with a unique set of institutional challenges. This study aims to investigate the corporatization processes undertaken by various government research and technology organizations (GR\&amp;TOs) in Malaysia, and then to evaluate their overall progress. The outcome of this study indicates that a myriad of challenges can be inverted into growth opportunities through the application of appropriate strategic planning.</jats:p>},

@article{Living_Labs_for_Zavrat_2019,
  abstract = {<jats:p>Living Labs are spaces for innovative and participative research, development and activities that use multidisciplinary approaches and promote the co-creation paradigm. Our specific interest lies in exploring the value of the Living Lab concept for creating environments that enable equal opportunities for people living in rural and urban areas, and for making rural areas attractive places to live. Moreover, through the existing practices and research results available, Living Labs are seen as one of the important building blocks of smart rural development and an important step towards establishing a Smart Village environment. Living Labs are a valuable player in enhancing circular economy, digital transformation, local self-sufficiency and other elements of sustainable living. The main aim of this paper is therefore to put Living Labs in the context of rural areas and evaluate their possible contributions for sustainable rural development. This paper argues that the element of community and social change should be considered as a key element in enabling sustainable living.</jats:p>},
