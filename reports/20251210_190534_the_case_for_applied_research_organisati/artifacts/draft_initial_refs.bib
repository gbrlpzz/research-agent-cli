  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Research and technology organizations (RTOs) are studied in the innovation policy literature mainly as providers of R\&amp;D services and as intermediaries between universities and the private sector. Through the case of the Institut National d’Optique (INO), Canada’s leading RTO in the optics and photonics industry, we argue that RTOs can also act as entrepreneurs by generating technologies and commercializing them through licensing, technology transfers and spin-offs. By analyzing the broad range of activities undertaken by INO, we also discuss what characteristics make some RTOs more likely to embrace entrepreneurship than others. Those characteristics include the following: renewed access to government funding to build a strong in-house research infrastructure and scientific workforce; strategic R\&amp;D planning that incorporates commercial objectives and an environment that encourages a culture of entrepreneurship among employees; the ability to act as the driving force of a network of academic, government and private sector organizations. From a policy perspective, the INO case indicates that the main value of using RTOs as entrepreneurship instruments does not lie in profitability but rather in developing dynamic regional systems of innovation.</jats:p>},

While participation in European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme <ns3:bold>and Horizon 2020</ns3:bold> is associated with stronger research capacities in already well-developed regions, no significant relationship is found between EU-funded R\&amp;D and increases in publications or patents at an aggregate level. However, a positive correlation emerges between EU R\&amp;D funding and <ns3:bold>GDP growth in less developed regions</ns3:bold>, suggesting that while direct scientific outputs may not always materialize, economic benefits arise through alternative channels such as <ns3:bold>small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) engagement</ns3:bold>, infrastructure improvements, and knowledge diffusion. Conclusions The study highlights the broader implications of transnational funding frameworks for regional economic convergence within the <ns3:bold>EU</ns3:bold>. Despite limited effects on immediate research outputs in less developed regions, competitive EU R\&amp;D programs contribute to economic resilience in lagging regions, raising important considerations for multi-level governance and international cooperation. These results align with debates in International Relations regarding the role of supra-national institutions in shaping equitable economic outcomes and addressing structural imbalances across Member States. As EU funding strategies evolve, a more integrated approach that strengthens innovation ecosystems in underperforming regions could enhance European research policy\textquotesingle s inclusivity and long-term impact.</ns3:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Scholarly work in economic geography and regional science has recently seen a renewed interest in spatial inequalities, driven significantly by the debate on left-behind places and the resulting geographies of discontent. The plight of left-behind places calls for new place-based policy responses that address the specific challenges of these regions but that at the same time address grand societal challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, or pollution with synthetic chemicals. Despite growing attention among economic geographers and regional scientists to either green or inclusive regional development approaches, how to reconcile environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness in highly challenged left-behind places remains poorly understood. This editorial reflects on and critically discusses the literature on left-behind places and distils unifying conceptual characteristics of left-behindness. We argue that left-behindness is a temporal, relational, multidimensional, discursive, but not deterministic concept. The non-determinism of left-behindness opens up different choices for actors to shape regional futures. Imagining and negotiating these futures involves dealing with difficult potential trade-offs between environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness, some of which are explored by the articles in this special issue.</jats:p>},

@article{Combining_knowl_Friedr_2024,
  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A growing number of economic geography scholars have discussed the spatial dimensions of sustainability transitions (STs), which entail radical changes in socio-technical systems to overcome societal, economic, and ecological problems. This involves innovation processes with a broad range of distinctive actors. Innovation intermediaries, such as universities and research institutes, are needed to support and accelerate the transfer of knowledge. Nevertheless, little is known about the influence of such actors on the configuration of the knowledge bases required for STs. This article presents insights from 14 semi-structured interviews with experts conducted in a regional innovation system (RIS) in East Germany. In cooperation with the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, we investigate four innovation intermediaries in the region of Eberswalde. The analytical framework links the concept of differentiated knowledge bases to small wins. Our results show that, first, in the Eberswalde region, the relevant actors involved in regional knowledge transfer focus predominantly on synthetic knowledge bases, such as experience-based knowledge of local area settings. Second, symbolic knowledge bases are crucial and often prerequisites for intermediary organizations to recombine knowledge bases and support the capability to innovate in regional knowledge transfer. Symbolic knowledge entails the ability to translate scientific findings to a language that can be understood by the various actors in knowledge transfer. Third, changes in organizational structures complement changes in cultural\textendash cognitive and normative institutions to support innovation on a systemic level and foster change processes.</jats:p>},

@article{The_Role_of_Pro_Nilsen_2018,
  abstract = {<jats:p>It is commonly argued in the literature on regional innovation that regions must continuously develop new economic activities to compensate for economic decline. If a region manages to diversify from an existing path, it can sustain long-term economic development. One of the measures taken to increase these types of opportunities and to avoid lock-in is to stimulate a closer relationship and collaboration between universities and industry partners. However, we know little about the formation and investigation of successful university-industry relationships in regions outside metropolitan areas. This paper seeks to fill this research gap by investigating how different dimensions of cognitive, organizational, social and geographical proximity facilitate or hinder innovation processes in collaborations between industry and universities in peripheral regions. We find that social proximity, combined with high organizational proximity, overcomes the barriers presented by low geographical proximity. Social proximity compensates for thin regional structures with few high-tech firms, a lack of knowledge producers and a weak support system. An important policy implication is that stimulating collaboration within areas of expertise possessed by university and industry partners create potential for innovation.</jats:p>},

The process requires the creation of an institutional structure (cooperation network) that allows for coordinated and continuous cooperation between representatives of entities that create regional innovation systems. These include: authorities, scientific and research units, entrepreneurs and civil society. The purpose of this article is to present the role of scientific and research units in the cooperation network, as well as the possibility of using their innovation potential when conducting EDP.
