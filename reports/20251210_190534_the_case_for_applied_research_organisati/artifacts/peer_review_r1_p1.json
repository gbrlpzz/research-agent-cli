  "full_text": "**VERDICT**: Minor Revisions\n\n**SUMMARY**:\nThis paper presents a compelling argument for the role of Applied Research Organisations (AROs/RTOs) in addressing territorial fragility within the EU. It effectively synthesizes recent literature (2018\u20132025) to link \"left-behind places\" with the specific capabilities of intermediary institutions. The connection between the \"Entrepreneurial Discovery Process\" (EDP) and the technical foresight provided by AROs is a particularly strong theoretical contribution. The document is well-structured and aligns well with the proposed research plan, though it relies heavily on very recent sources for concepts that have deeper theoretical roots.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n- **Timeliness and Relevance**: The focus on \"left-behind places\" and \"territorial fragility\" aligns with the current post-2020 EU Cohesion Policy agenda.\n- **Theoretical Integration**: Successfully bridges the gap between *Regional Innovation Systems* (RIS) theory and practical policy mechanisms like RIS3/EDP.\n- **Strong Use of Recent Literature**: The inclusion of 2024 and 2025 references (e.g., @Bridging_Europe_Chumac_2025, @Sustainable_and_Benner_2024) demonstrates up-to-date engagement with the field.\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n- **Terminology**: The paper primarily uses the term \"ARO\" (Applied Research Organisation). While valid, the standard term in EU policy and innovation studies is \"RTO\" (Research and Technology Organisation). Using \"ARO\" might limit the paper's discoverability and alignment with standard EU nomenclature (e.g., EARTO).\n- **Attribution of Established Concepts**: The \"Regional Innovation Paradox\" is attributed to @Bridging_Europe_Chumac_2025. While Chumac likely discusses it, the concept was originally defined by Oughton et al. (2002). Citing only the recent paper obscures the foundational nature of this theory.\n- **Governance Depth**: The \"Discussion\" section touches on governance but lacks detail on *how* AROs in lagging regions avoid \"institutional capture\" by local elites\u2014a key risk in fragile institutional environments mentioned in the introduction.\n\n**RECOMMENDED PAPERS**:\nRECOMMEND SEARCH: \"Oughton Landabaso regional innovation paradox\" | Reason: To properly attribute the foundational concept of the innovation paradox.\nRECOMMEND SEARCH: \"Morgan regional innovation systems\" | Reason: To ground the \"institutional void\" argument in classic RIS literature.\n\n**SPECIFIC EDITS**:\n\n**Section: Introduction**\n- **Issue**: Terminology consistency.\n- **Suggestion**: Consider switching primarily to \"RTO\" after the first definition, or explicitly stating that \"ARO\" is used synonymously with the EU standard \"RTO\" throughout.\n\n**Section: Theoretical Framework**\n- **Issue**: Citation for \"Regional Innovation Paradox\".\n- **Suggestion**: \"A key theoretical constraint... is the 'regional innovation paradox' (Oughton et al., 2002), recently re-evaluated by @Bridging_Europe_Chumac_2025...\"\n\n**Section: AROs and Industrial Modernisation**\n- **Issue**: Claim \"AROs serve as demonstration sites\".\n- **Suggestion**: This is a strong claim. Ensure @Smart_specialis_Barzot_2020 explicitly discusses \"demonstration sites\" or \"living labs\". If not, qualify the statement or add a reference regarding \"Digital Innovation Hubs\" (DIHs), which are the EU instrument for this function.\n\n**Section: Discussion and Policy Implications**\n- **Issue**: Funding models.\n- **Suggestion**: Expand on the \"core funding\" argument. Mention that competitive funding often exacerbates the divide (the \"Matthew Effect\") and that *non-competitive* block grants are essential for capacity building in lagging regions."
