  "main_question": "Is there a case to be made for applied research organisations to address territorial fragility in the context of the European Union. The EU 2028-2034 research plan has already arrived at some conclusions on the need for applied research and innovation. We want to understand how well we can build this claim so we can structure a research organisation to tackle territorial fragility within this political mandate. Territorial fragility is a real issue in the European Union when urbanisation has been completed as a demographic shift and territorial governance has not been fully transformed to ensure a strategic positioning for what used to be inhabited rural landscapes. By ARO we mean a research and innovation organisation centred around a specific problem area pursuing an answer through an applied and experimental approach, sitting in Pasteurs Quadrant: high utility plus high contribution to knowledge. This paper seeks to argue for the positioning of this kind of organisation in the institutional environment of territorial governance by uncovering its relevance and evaluating cases that signal the emergent state of the art within fragile territories.",
