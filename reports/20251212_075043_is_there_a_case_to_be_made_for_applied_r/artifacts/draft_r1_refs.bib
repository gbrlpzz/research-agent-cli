@article{Cohesion_or_Wid_Pato_2023,
  abstract = {<jats:p>This comprehensive analysis investigates the effectiveness of EU funding in promoting research and innovation across various regions, with a specific focus on the Horizon Europe Programme. In this study, we employed a mixed-quantitative analysis of funding allocation data sourced from the Horizon Europe Dashboard and the Global Innovation Index. We systematically analysed the distribution of Horizon Europe funds from 2021 to 2023 across all EU Member States and their respective NUTS 2 regions, focusing on per capita and per researcher fund allocation. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted to assess the alignment between fund distribution and innovation indicators such as R\&amp;D intensity and innovation outputs.The study also critically examines the EU’s cohesion policy, which is fundamentally designed to reduce regional disparities and promote equal opportunities across all EU regions. Through our analysis, we aim to assess whether the current implementation of the EU’s financial instruments aligns with the overarching goals of cohesion policy, particularly in terms of fostering uniform economic growth and development. This examination is crucial as it highlights the need for the values of cohesion to be more effectively integrated into the criteria systems of directly managed EU funding programs to achieve its intended objectives of regional and territorial cohesion.The study reveals persistent and widening disparities in the distribution of funds, which accentuate regional and national inequalities within the EU. Despite significant financial allocations aimed at fostering innovation, the evidence points to a concentrated benefit in specific regions, particularly those already developed, thereby raising concerns about the equitable promotion of technological advancement and economic growth across less developed areas. The findings underscore the need for a more balanced and strategic approach to funding that ensures all regions can contribute to and benefit from Europe’s innovation landscape. This research contributes crucial insights into the complexities of funding allocation, the challenges of regional disparities, and the potential pathways towards a more inclusive innovation policy within the European Union.</jats:p>},

While participation in European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme <ns3:bold>and Horizon 2020</ns3:bold> is associated with stronger research capacities in already well-developed regions, no significant relationship is found between EU-funded R\&amp;D and increases in publications or patents at an aggregate level. However, a positive correlation emerges between EU R\&amp;D funding and <ns3:bold>GDP growth in less developed regions</ns3:bold>, suggesting that while direct scientific outputs may not always materialize, economic benefits arise through alternative channels such as <ns3:bold>small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) engagement</ns3:bold>, infrastructure improvements, and knowledge diffusion. Conclusions The study highlights the broader implications of transnational funding frameworks for regional economic convergence within the <ns3:bold>EU</ns3:bold>. Despite limited effects on immediate research outputs in less developed regions, competitive EU R\&amp;D programs contribute to economic resilience in lagging regions, raising important considerations for multi-level governance and international cooperation. These results align with debates in International Relations regarding the role of supra-national institutions in shaping equitable economic outcomes and addressing structural imbalances across Member States. As EU funding strategies evolve, a more integrated approach that strengthens innovation ecosystems in underperforming regions could enhance European research policy\textquotesingle s inclusivity and long-term impact.</ns3:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An emerging field of research suggests that the policy and societal pressures for a green transition represent a \textquotedblleft green window of opportunity\textquotedblright  for peripheral regions. These regions often lag behind in overall innovation performance and may suffer from being places that don’t matter. At the same time, these are exactly the regions that the European Union is trying to support through several programmes, including Horizon Europe. This paper investigates the participation of organisations from peripheral regions in environmental projects funded by the Horizon Europe programme. To account for the multidimensional nature of regional peripherality, we define peripheral regions from a geographical, innovation and socio-economic perspective. We then analyse the relationship between these dimensions of regional peripherality and the extent to which regions benefit from Horizon environmental innovation projects in terms of participation, amount of funding and position in the overall network of project consortia.</jats:p><jats:p>Our findings show a greater participation in Horizon environmental innovation projects for regions in Southern and Northern Europe, while within-country peripherality is negatively related to participation. At the same time, regions that are lagging in terms of innovation and socio-economic performance also receive less of this specific funding. Overall, geographical peripherality only tells a part of the story as several \textquotedblleft places that don’t matter\textquotedblright  for innovation and economic dynamism are also unable to benefit from these specific green windows of opportunity.</jats:p>},

<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to propose a contingent model that facilitates knowledge of the strategies followed by the research technology organizations (RTOs) of Valencia and the Basque Country, Spain, to adapt to the turbulence of their environment.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>
<jats:p>The research includes context, organizational and results variables and identifies some barriers that the RTOs encounter in collaborating with SMEs and also the best practices they follow to develop competitive advantages. The methodology used consisted of applying the proposed model to the 27 RTOs of both autonomous regions; a factor analysis was then performed to determine whether there exist groups of related (correlated) variables; finally, the authors proceeded to carry out a hierarchical cluster analysis to observe how the 27 RTOs are distributed according to their ability to adapt and respond to environmental turbulence.</jats:p>

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>In recent decades, research has begun to examine the concept of the regional policy mix and its implications for regional innovation. While this has highlighted the role of interactions between multilevel policy instruments and the potential for duplication and synergies, it has tended to underplay the contribution of policy actors to managing such policy mix processes. This paper seeks to add to this literature by introducing the concept of boundary work, viewing it as a form of agency practice seeking to create, maintain, and disrupt instruments within the policy mix. Through a case study of digital technology diffusion instruments in Wales (UK), this paper examines the actors, practices, and effects of boundary work in the regional policy mix. The findings show that boundary work can help manage tensions in the policy mix through anticipatory practices but that complexity and uncertainty in the regional innovation policy mix present ongoing challenges to policymakers.</jats:p>},
