--- REVIEWER 1 (major_revisions) ---
Summary: The document presents a compelling theoretical argument for integrating Applied Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) into the EU's FP10 programming to address territorial fragility. The distinction between "excellence-based" (Horizon) and "cohesion-based" (Structural Funds) policies is well-articulated, and the proposal for a "Territorial Resilience" instrument is timely. However, the manuscript suffers from **significant citation mismatches and context errors**. Several key claims rely on literature drawn from radically different contexts (e.g., post-conflict reconstruction in Afghanistan, industrial policy in Tanzania) without sufficient justification for their transferability to the EU. Additionally, some citations appear to be misattributed or contradict the cited papers' actual findings (e.g., regarding the economic impact of EU funding on lagging regions).
Weaknesses: - **Contextual Mismatch (Citation Padding)**: The use of *Sheikheldin (2021)* (a case study on Tanzania) to define the role of European RTOs like Fraunhofer is methodologically weak. Similarly, citing *Itiade & Oluwole (2025)* (on post-conflict peacebuilding in South Sudan/Afghanistan) to argue for EU regional innovation policy is a rhetorical stretch that undermines rigor.
- **Misrepresentation of Evidence**: The manuscript cites *Chumachenko et al. (2025)* to argue that funding "exacerbates the innovation divide," yet the abstract of that paper suggests a "positive correlation... between EU R&D funding and GDP growth in less developed regions," implying a convergence effect, not just divergence.
- **Unsupported Attribution**: The claim that *Wibisono (2022)* argues regions "mimic" successful hubs appears unsupported by the text of that review, which focuses on capacity and governance challenges rather than isomorphism/mimicry.
