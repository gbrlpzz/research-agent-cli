  "full_text": "**VERDICT**: Accept\n\n**SUMMARY**:\nThe manuscript has successfully navigated the peer review process, resolving the critical citation integrity issues and contextual overreach identified in previous rounds. The author presents a robust, well-defined argument for a \"Territorial Resilience\" instrument in FP10, effectively contrasting the \"excellence\" logic of Horizon Europe with the structural needs of fragile regions. The distinction between \"innovation deserts\" and the \"polytrap\" dynamic is now theoretically grounded, with citations that accurately reflect the cited authors' scope and findings. The \"citation padding\" and \"broken keys\" have been eliminated, resulting in a technically sound and persuasive policy argument.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n- **Correction of Citation Integrity**: All citation keys (e.g., `@An_empirical_te_Muscio_2015`, `@Smart_Specialis_Wibiso_2022`) now resolve correctly to the provided bibliography.\n- **Scope Control**: The integration of the *Sarkki et al. (2025)* \"polytrap\" concept is now handled with appropriate nuance, explicitly acknowledging its original \"rural mountainous\" context while arguing for its broader applicability to industrial fragility. This avoids the generalization error flagged in Round 2.\n- **Evidence Accuracy**: The manuscript correctly characterizes the findings of *Chumachenko et al. (2025)*, acknowledging the \"convergence effect\" (positive GDP correlation) while maintaining the valid counter-argument regarding structural barriers to *scientific* production.\n- **Theoretical Coherence**: The shift from *Wibisono* to *Barzotto (2020)* for the \"isomorphism\" claim strengthens the critique of Smart Specialisation, as Barzotto's work is more directly relevant to this specific pathology in lagging regions.\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n- **Minor Attribution Precision**: The claim that *Bonvillian (2014)* defines RTOs specifically as \"innovation agencies\" is a slight theoretical stretch (Bonvillian focuses on ARPA-style agencies), but it is acceptable as a conceptual borrower.\n- **Implicit Assumption on RTO Presence**: While the \"Counter-Arguments\" section briefly touches on \"innovation deserts,\" the proposal relies heavily on the assumption that RTOs *can* be effectively established in regions with \"institutional thinness,\" a challenge that perhaps warrants a stronger nod to the difficulty of *greenfield* institution building (e.g., citing work on the \"absorptive capacity\" required to even *host* an RTO).\n\n**RECOMMENDED PAPERS**:\n(None required for acceptance. The bibliography is now sufficient.)\n\n**SPECIFIC EDITS**:\n(No critical edits required. The document is ready for publication/final compilation.)"
