  "main_question": "To what extent does the emerging policy framework for the EU's 10th Framework Programme (FP10) incentivize Applied Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) to prioritize territorial fragility and place-based innovation strategies?",
  "sub_questions": [
    "How is 'territorial fragility' currently defined and operationalized in EU Cohesion Policy and Horizon Europe impact assessments?",
    "What specific barriers do RTOs currently face in deploying place-based solutions in 'lagging regions' or 'innovation valleys' compared to central metropolitan hubs?",
    "Does evidence from Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe suggest that Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3/S4) have successfully engaged RTOs in addressing regional disparities?",
    "What proposed mechanisms in the FP10 consultation documents link research funding to territorial cohesion or the reduction of the innovation divide?",
    "How do mission-oriented innovation policies (MOIP) specifically address the geographical distribution of RTO activities in vulnerable territories?"
