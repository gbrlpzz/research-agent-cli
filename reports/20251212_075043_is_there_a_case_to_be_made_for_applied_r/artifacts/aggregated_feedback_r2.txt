Summary: The manuscript has significantly improved in its theoretical coherence and has successfully addressed the "citation padding" issue by removing the irrelevant case studies (Tanzania, Afghanistan) flagged in Round 1. The integration of Peñalosa & Castaldi (2024) to support the "green window" argument is excellent and evidence-based. However, the document is currently technically invalid due to **multiple missing bibliography entries** (broken citation keys) and potential scope overreach regarding the "Polytraps" concept. While the author fixed the *misattribution* of the "isomorphism" claim (moving it from Wibisono to Barzotto), the new citations often fail to compile or link to the provided bibliography. Immediate technical fixes and a scope check on the Sarkki citation are required before acceptance.
Weaknesses: - **Critical Citation Integrity**: Four citation keys used in the text do not exist in the provided `refs.bib`. This prevents the document from compiling or being verified.

- **Contextual Scope (Sarkki)**: The manuscript cites *Sarkki et al. (2025)* to define a general "polytrap" for fragile regions. However, the title of this paper ("Polytraps in European **rural mountainous regions**") suggests a specific geographical context. Generalizing "mountainous" constraints to *all* fragile regions (which may include industrial decline areas or coastal peripheries) requires a qualifying statement to avoid the "Contextual Mismatch" error flagged in Round 1.
- **Unverified Source Access**: While *Priebe & Herberg (2024)* and *Foglia (2025)* are cited, the review system could not verify the specific claims about "spatial blindness" or "bureaucratic burden" against the text. Ensure these claims are explicitly supported by the papers' findings, not just their general topics.
