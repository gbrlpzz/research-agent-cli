  "full_text": "**VERDICT**: Major Revisions\n\n**SUMMARY**:\nThe manuscript has significantly improved in its theoretical coherence and has successfully addressed the \"citation padding\" issue by removing the irrelevant case studies (Tanzania, Afghanistan) flagged in Round 1. The integration of Pe\u00f1alosa & Castaldi (2024) to support the \"green window\" argument is excellent and evidence-based. However, the document is currently technically invalid due to **multiple missing bibliography entries** (broken citation keys) and potential scope overreach regarding the \"Polytraps\" concept. While the author fixed the *misattribution* of the \"isomorphism\" claim (moving it from Wibisono to Barzotto), the new citations often fail to compile or link to the provided bibliography. Immediate technical fixes and a scope check on the Sarkki citation are required before acceptance.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n- **Addressed Counter-Evidence**: The revision regarding *Chumachenko et al. (2025)* is accurate; acknowledging the \"potential convergence effect\" while maintaining the argument about structural barriers adds nuance and rigor.\n- **Improved Claim Attribution**: Moving the \"isomorphism\" claim to *Barzotto (2020)* and the \"green window\" claim to *Pe\u00f1alosa & Castaldi (2024)* strengthens the evidence base, as these papers are contextually appropriate.\n- **Theoretical Clarity**: The distinction between \"peace-informed\" stability and \"cohesion-informed\" resilience is a strong, novel contribution to the FP10 debate.\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n- **Critical Citation Integrity**: Four citation keys used in the text do not exist in the provided `refs.bib`. This prevents the document from compiling or being verified.\n    - `@wibisono2022innovationandsmart` (Missing)\n    - `@muscio2015anempiricaltest` (Missing)\n    - `@michaela2019shapingsmartspecialization` (Missing)\n    - `@barzotto2020smartspecialisationindustry` (Missing)\n- **Contextual Scope (Sarkki)**: The manuscript cites *Sarkki et al. (2025)* to define a general \"polytrap\" for fragile regions. However, the title of this paper (\"Polytraps in European **rural mountainous regions**\") suggests a specific geographical context. Generalizing \"mountainous\" constraints to *all* fragile regions (which may include industrial decline areas or coastal peripheries) requires a qualifying statement to avoid the \"Contextual Mismatch\" error flagged in Round 1.\n- **Unverified Source Access**: While *Priebe & Herberg (2024)* and *Foglia (2025)* are cited, the review system could not verify the specific claims about \"spatial blindness\" or \"bureaucratic burden\" against the text. Ensure these claims are explicitly supported by the papers' findings, not just their general topics.\n\n**SPECIFIC EDITS**:\n\nSection: **Introduction**\nIssue: Invalid Citation Key.\nSuggestion: Replace `@wibisono2022innovationandsmart` with the correct key from your library (likely `@Smart_Specialis_Wibiso_2022`). Ensure the \"mixed results\" claim is supported by the abstract.\n\nSection: **Introduction**\nIssue: Invalid Citation Key.\nSuggestion: Replace `@muscio2015anempiricaltest` with `@An_empirical_te_Muscio_2015` (if this is the intended paper on the \"innovation paradox\").\n\nSection: **Defining Territorial Fragility...**\nIssue: Invalid Citation Key.\nSuggestion: Replace `@michaela2019shapingsmartspecialization` with `@Shaping_smart_s_Trippl_2020` (Note the year change 2019 -> 2020 if using the library version).\n\nSection: **Defining Territorial Fragility...**\nIssue: Scope Generalization.\nSuggestion: When citing `@Polytraps_in_Eu_Sarkki_2025`, add a qualifier: \"Drawing on concepts from rural development, this 'polytrap' creates a vicious cycle...\" to acknowledge the specific context of the source.\n\nSection: **Critique of Current Policy Frameworks**\nIssue: Invalid Citation Key.\nSuggestion: Replace `@barzotto2020smartspecialisationindustry` with `@Smart_specialis_Barzot_2020` or `@The_Future_of_P_Barzot_2020` depending on which specific paper discusses \"isomorphism\".\n\nSection: **Critique of Current Policy Frameworks**\nIssue: Unverified Claim (\"bureaucratic burden\").\nSuggestion: Ensure `@The_impact_of_E_Foglia_2025` explicitly contrasts ERDF bureaucracy with Horizon Europe. If not, cite *Oughton et al. (2002)* or *Ferry et al.* for administrative capacity issues."
