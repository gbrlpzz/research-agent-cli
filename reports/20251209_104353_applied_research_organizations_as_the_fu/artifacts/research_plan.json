  "sub_questions": [
    "How do AROs effectively mitigate the 'Valley of Death' between academic discovery (low TRL) and industry implementation (high TRL) compared to traditional university technology transfer offices?",
    "What economic and structural factors have led to the decline of monolithic corporate research labs (e.g., Bell Labs) and the subsequent rise of independent or state-sponsored applied research institutes?",
    "How do different funding models (public-private partnerships, block grants, contract research) influence the autonomy and strategic direction of AROs like Fraunhofer, SRI International, or the Catapult network?",
    "What role do AROs play in 'Deep Tech' sectors where capital intensity and long time horizons deter venture capital and standard corporate R&D?"
