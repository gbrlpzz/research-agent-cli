Through the case of the Institut National d’Optique (INO), Canada’s leading RTO in the optics and photonics industry, we argue that RTOs can also act as entrepreneurs by generating technologies and commercializing them through licensing, technology transfers and spin-offs. By analyzing the broad range of activities undertaken by INO, we also discuss what characteristics make some RTOs more likely to embrace entrepreneurship than others. Those characteristics include the following: renewed access to government funding to build a strong in-house research infrastructure and scientific workforce; strategic R\&amp;D planning that incorporates commercial objectives and an environment that encourages a culture of entrepreneurship among employees; the ability to act as the driving force of a network of academic, government and private sector organizations. From a policy perspective, the INO case indicates that the main value of using RTOs as entrepreneurship instruments does not lie in profitability but rather in developing dynamic regional systems of innovation.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The European Union\textquotesingle s flagship Cohesion Policy faces evidence of dubious economic effectiveness and growing political and philosophical critiques of the very ideals of furthering European integration. This article examines ambitions for territorial cohesion as they have been operationalized through regional development in Wales. We argue that a potential alternative to the failed realization of territorial cohesion lies in the principles of spatial justice. While territorial cohesion has typically emphasized the redistribution of funds to ‘lagging’ regions, spatial justice, as we define it, is premised upon enabling regions to assert their own capacity to act and pursue positive visions of regional futures, consider the implications of space and scale for the achievement of justice, and define well‐being, development and the ‘good life’ in ways that reflect regional priorities. We examine three ways in which recent political discourses and policy mechanisms in Wales resonate with these ideals. We focus on attempts to envision a progressive Welsh future, develop alternative spaces and scales of governance, and redefine and pluralize understandings of progress and well‐being. The article concludes by reflecting on the practical and conceptual implications of rescaling spatial justice to regional contexts.</jats:p>},

@article{Cohesion_or_Wid_Pato_2023,
  abstract = {<jats:p>This comprehensive analysis investigates the effectiveness of EU funding in promoting research and innovation across various regions, with a specific focus on the Horizon Europe Programme. In this study, we employed a mixed-quantitative analysis of funding allocation data sourced from the Horizon Europe Dashboard and the Global Innovation Index. We systematically analysed the distribution of Horizon Europe funds from 2021 to 2023 across all EU Member States and their respective NUTS 2 regions, focusing on per capita and per researcher fund allocation. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted to assess the alignment between fund distribution and innovation indicators such as R\&amp;D intensity and innovation outputs.The study also critically examines the EU’s cohesion policy, which is fundamentally designed to reduce regional disparities and promote equal opportunities across all EU regions. Through our analysis, we aim to assess whether the current implementation of the EU’s financial instruments aligns with the overarching goals of cohesion policy, particularly in terms of fostering uniform economic growth and development. This examination is crucial as it highlights the need for the values of cohesion to be more effectively integrated into the criteria systems of directly managed EU funding programs to achieve its intended objectives of regional and territorial cohesion.The study reveals persistent and widening disparities in the distribution of funds, which accentuate regional and national inequalities within the EU. Despite significant financial allocations aimed at fostering innovation, the evidence points to a concentrated benefit in specific regions, particularly those already developed, thereby raising concerns about the equitable promotion of technological advancement and economic growth across less developed areas. The findings underscore the need for a more balanced and strategic approach to funding that ensures all regions can contribute to and benefit from Europe’s innovation landscape. This research contributes crucial insights into the complexities of funding allocation, the challenges of regional disparities, and the potential pathways towards a more inclusive innovation policy within the European Union.</jats:p>},

While participation in European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme <ns3:bold>and Horizon 2020</ns3:bold> is associated with stronger research capacities in already well-developed regions, no significant relationship is found between EU-funded R\&amp;D and increases in publications or patents at an aggregate level. However, a positive correlation emerges between EU R\&amp;D funding and <ns3:bold>GDP growth in less developed regions</ns3:bold>, suggesting that while direct scientific outputs may not always materialize, economic benefits arise through alternative channels such as <ns3:bold>small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) engagement</ns3:bold>, infrastructure improvements, and knowledge diffusion. Conclusions The study highlights the broader implications of transnational funding frameworks for regional economic convergence within the <ns3:bold>EU</ns3:bold>. Despite limited effects on immediate research outputs in less developed regions, competitive EU R\&amp;D programs contribute to economic resilience in lagging regions, raising important considerations for multi-level governance and international cooperation. These results align with debates in International Relations regarding the role of supra-national institutions in shaping equitable economic outcomes and addressing structural imbalances across Member States. As EU funding strategies evolve, a more integrated approach that strengthens innovation ecosystems in underperforming regions could enhance European research policy\textquotesingle s inclusivity and long-term impact.</ns3:p>},

but some weaknesses persist. Lagging regions are more engaged on the platforms and
