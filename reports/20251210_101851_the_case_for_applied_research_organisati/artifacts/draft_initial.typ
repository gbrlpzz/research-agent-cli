    This paper examines the strategic role of Applied Research Organisations (AROs) and Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) in mitigating territorial fragility within the European Union. While traditionally concentrated in innovation-rich regions, AROs are increasingly recognized as critical intermediaries for "lagging" or "left-behind" places. By synthesizing recent literature, we argue that AROs function as vital institutional anchors that bridge the "innovation paradox" through three specific mechanisms: facilitating "small wins" via incremental innovation, acting as conduits for global knowledge flows, and enabling regions to leapfrog via "green windows of opportunity." We analyse their pivotal role in implementing Smart Specialisation Strategies (RIS3) and conclude that strengthening the ARO network in peripheral Europe is a necessary condition for achieving genuine territorial cohesion.

= Introduction
The persistence of regional disparities within the European Union remains a formidable challenge to the project of territorial cohesion. despite decades of Cohesion Policy interventions, a "geography of discontent" has emerged, characterized by regions that feel "left behind" by the agglomeration economies of metropolitan hubs @The_Geography_o_Rodrig_2024 @Left_behind_pl_Pike_2024. These territories, often termed "lagging regions" or "fragile territories," face a dual trap: they lack the institutional capacity to absorb innovation funds effectively, yet they desperately require innovation-led growth to escape stagnation @An_empirical_te_Muscio_2015.

In this context, Applied Research Organisations (AROs) and Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs)—such as Fraunhofer in Germany or VTT in Finland—have traditionally been viewed as engines for advanced manufacturing in industrial powerhouses @Public_Research_Loikka_2011. However, a growing body of literature suggests a paradigm shift is necessary: AROs must be reimagined not just as elite technology providers, but as essential "super intermediaries" for peripheral development @Research_and_Te_Sheikh_2021 @Research_and_te_Khelfa_2023.

This paper presents the case for AROs as strategic tools to address territorial fragility. We argue that AROs provide the "institutional thickness" missing in fragile regions, acting as bridges that connect local actors to global knowledge pipelines @Oasis_in_the_de_Atta_O_2019. Unlike universities, which focus on basic research, AROs are uniquely positioned to translate high-level science into the "small wins" necessary for incremental regional upgrading @Combining_knowl_Friedr_2024. Furthermore, recent policy developments suggest that the green transition offers a specific "window of opportunity" for these regions, provided they have the intermediary structures to seize it @Horizon_Europe_Penalo_2024.

= Defining Territorial Fragility in the EU Context
## From Lagging Regions to Left-Behind Places
The terminology surrounding disadvantaged EU regions has evolved from static economic indicators to more relational concepts. "Lagging regions" have traditionally been defined by low GDP per capita or low growth rates relative to the EU average @Smart_specialis_Barzot_2020. However, recent scholarship emphasizes the concept of "territorial fragility" or "left-behind places," which captures a multidimensional condition of demographic decline, infrastructural decay, and a thinning institutional fabric @Sustainable_and_Benner_2024.

Rodriguez-Pose and Dijkstra (2024) argue that the "development trap" is not merely about poverty but about the long-term stagnation of regions that once had economic purpose but have lost their competitive edge @The_Geography_o_Rodrig_2024. This stagnation breeds political discontent and erodes trust in European institutions @Bridging_Europe_Chumac_2025. In these contexts, the "regional innovation paradox" becomes acute: the regions with the greatest need for innovation policy are those with the lowest capacity to implement it effectively @An_empirical_te_Muscio_2015.

## The Institutional Void
A defining characteristic of territorial fragility is the absence of effective intermediary institutions. In innovation-rich regions, a dense network of technology transfer offices, incubators, and private R&D labs facilitates the flow of knowledge. In fragile regions, this ecosystem is often fragmented or non-existent @New_tech_spaces_Ciapet_2018. The "triple helix" of government-industry-university relations is often broken, with universities disconnected from the local low-tech SME base @From_Territoria_Jones_2020.

It is into this institutional void that AROs must step. Unlike standard academic departments, AROs have a mandate to bridge the "valley of death" between research and commercial application @Research_and_te_Khelfa_2023. Their mission-oriented structure allows them to align specifically with regional development goals rather than purely academic metrics @Revitalizing_de_Somogy_2025.

= Mechanisms of Transformation
The literature identifies three specific mechanisms through which AROs can catalyze development in fragile territories: the generation of small wins, the bridging of global knowledge flows, and the exploitation of green windows of opportunity.

## Facilitating "Small Wins"
For many peripheral regions, radical innovation is neither feasible nor immediately desirable. Instead, Friedrich and Feser (2024) demonstrate that intermediaries facilitate "small wins"—incremental, cumulative innovations that combine technical, social, and organizational improvements @Combining_knowl_Friedr_2024.

AROs facilitate these small wins by:
- *Combining Knowledge Bases:* Merging external technical knowledge with local tacit knowledge to solve specific, manageable problems for local SMEs.
- *lowering Thresholds:* Providing accessible, low-risk entry points for firms to engage with R&D, which is crucial in regions with low absorptive capacity.
- *Building Trust:* Acting as neutral brokers that reduce the social risk of collaboration in low-trust environments @Inter_organisat_Kruse_2024.

These small wins, while modest in isolation, build the "absorptive capacity" required for more ambitious future projects, effectively training the region to innovate @Combining_knowl_Friedr_2024.

## Bridging Global Knowledge Flows
Fragile regions suffer from a lack of "buzz" and local knowledge spillovers. To compensate, they must tap into "global pipelines" of information. Atta-Owusu (2019) describes how "bridging academics" and research organisations act as conduits for these global flows @Oasis_in_the_de_Atta_O_2019.

AROs are particularly effective at this because they are often part of larger national or European networks (e.g., the EARTO network). A local branch of a major RTO can bring world-class expertise to a remote region, effectively "importing" the innovation system that the region lacks locally @New_tech_spaces_Ciapet_2018. This function is critical for preventing "lock-in" to obsolete technologies, a common trap for specialized industrial regions in decline @Smart_specialis_Barzot_2020.

## Green Windows of Opportunity
The twin transition (green and digital) presents a unique opportunity for peripheral regions to "leapfrog" older industrial models. Peñalosa and Castaldi (2024) argue that "green windows of opportunity" arise from the high policy pressure for environmental sustainability, which can favor regions with specific natural resources or the ability to deploy new infrastructure rapidly @Horizon_Europe_Penalo_2024.

AROs are essential for translating these high-level opportunities into local reality. For example, an ARO can adapt general renewable energy technologies to specific local geographic conditions, or help local agricultural firms adopt precision farming techniques demanded by EU regulations @Bridging_Europe_Chumac_2025. Without the technical translation provided by AROs, these "windows" often become threats rather than opportunities for lagging regions @Tracking_the_Gr_Tijani_2025.

= AROs and Smart Specialisation (RIS3)
The Smart Specialisation Strategy (RIS3) is the cornerstone of EU Cohesion Policy's innovation agenda. It requires regions to identify and prioritize their unique competitive advantages. However, lagging regions often struggle with the "Entrepreneurial Discovery Process" (EDP)—the bottom-up consultation required to identify these priorities @Smart_specialis_Barzot_2020.

## Anchoring the Quadruple Helix
AROs play a stabilizing role in the RIS3 process. Barzotto et al. (2020) emphasize that in regions with weak government capacity and risk-averse private sectors, research organisations often become the de facto leaders of the innovation strategy @Smart_specialis_Barzot_2020. They serve as:
- *Knowledge Repositories:* Providing the data and analysis needed to justify strategic choices to Brussels.
- *Continuity Agents:* Maintaining strategic focus across political cycles, which is often a source of instability in fragile regions.
- *Connectors:* Linking the region to European thematic platforms and partnerships @10_years_of_coo_Szavic_2025.

## Addressing the Innovation Paradox
The "innovation paradox" suggests that R&D investment yields lower returns in lagging regions due to a lack of complementary assets. AROs directly address this by supplying those assets—specifically, the testing facilities, pilot lines, and certification services that individual firms cannot afford @An_empirical_te_Muscio_2015. By sharing these costs across many users, AROs make innovation economically viable in low-density markets.

= Conclusion
The territorial fragility of Europe's periphery is not merely a problem of funding, but a problem of institutional architecture. The evidence suggests that Applied Research Organisations are not luxury goods for advanced economies, but essential infrastructure for cohesion.

To function as effective tools for territorial resilience, AROs in fragile regions must:
1.  *Prioritize Diffusion over Discovery:* Focus on adopting and adapting existing technologies ("small wins") rather than chasing Nobel-prize level breakthroughs @Combining_knowl_Friedr_2024.
2.  *Act as Gateways:* Deliberately structure themselves to import global knowledge and translate it for local SMEs @Oasis_in_the_de_Atta_O_2019.
3.  *Embed in RIS3:* Move beyond service provision to become strategic partners in regional governance @Smart_specialis_Barzot_2020.

Policy-makers should view the establishment and support of AROs in lagging regions not as a subsidy for science, but as a structural investment in the region's capacity to have a future.
