  "main_question": "To what extent does a strategic alignment of Applied Research Organisations (RTOs) with the objectives of territorial cohesion provide a viable framework for mitigating territorial fragility within the European Union's 2028-2034 Framework Programme (FP10)?",
  "sub_questions": [
    "How is 'territorial fragility' defined in current EU cohesion policy, and what are the specific innovation deficits characterizing these 'left-behind' places?",
    "What is the current capacity and track record of RTOs in delivering place-based innovation outcomes compared to fundamental research institutions?",
    "How can the Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3/S4) be evolved in the 2028-2034 programming period to explicitly leverage RTOs as regional anchors?",
    "What are the potential policy mechanisms within the anticipated structure of FP10 that could incentivize RTOs to prioritize geographically peripheral or fragile ecosystems?"
