  "main_question": "To what extent can Applied Research Organisations (AROs) operating in Pasteur's Quadrant effectively address territorial fragility within the European Union's 2028-2034 research and innovation framework, and how does this institutional model bridge the gap between post-urbanisation demographics and current territorial governance?",
  "sub_questions": [
    "How is 'territorial fragility' defined in the context of the EU's completed demographic shift towards urbanisation, and where do current governance models fail these landscapes?",
    "What specific opportunities does the EU 2028-2034 research mandate (FP10) offer for mission-oriented, applied research institutions focusing on regional cohesion?",
    "How does the 'Pasteur's Quadrant' model (high utility/high fundamental knowledge) specifically benefit territorial governance compared to traditional basic research or purely commercial consultancy?",
    "What are the defining characteristics and operational structures of existing 'emergent state of the art' organisations tackling territorial issues through experimental approaches?",
    "How should a new ARO be institutionally positioned to influence policy-making while maintaining the autonomy required for experimental territorial innovation?"
