  "full_text": "**VERDICT**: Major Revisions\n\n**SUMMARY**:\nThis paper presents a forward-looking argument for establishing \"Pasteur\u2019s Quadrant\" organizations to address territorial fragility in the EU's upcoming FP10 framework. The theoretical application of Stokes\u2019 model to regional innovation policy is original and compelling. However, the document fails to meet academic standards due to **persistent missing citations** (which appear to be hallucinations), the use of non-standard terminology (\"ARO\" vs \"RTO\"), and a failure to engage with the extensive \"Third Mission\" literature, creating a strawman argument against universities. These issues must be resolved before publication.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n-   **Theoretical Framework**: The adaptation of Stokes\u2019 \"Pasteur\u2019s Quadrant\" to define a new type of territorial governance entity is a strong, novel contribution.\n-   **Policy Relevance**: The paper effectively links abstract innovation theory to concrete EU policy instruments (Smart Specialization, Horizon Europe).\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n-   **Missing/Hallucinated Citations**: The citations `@10_years_of_coo_Szavic_2025` and `@Gwiazdzinska2022` remain missing from the bibliography. Furthermore, searches suggest these papers may not exist. You must either provide the DOIs or replace them with valid references.\n-   **Non-Standard Terminology**: The paper persists in using \"ARO\" (Applied Research Organization). The standard European term is **RTO** (Research and Technology Organisation), represented by EARTO. Using \"ARO\" creates unnecessary friction for policy readers.\n-   **Strawman Argument against Universities**: The critique of universities as purely \"Bohr\" (fundamental research) ignores the vast literature on the \"Third Mission\" (regional engagement). You argue universities *cannot* do this, but literature shows they *do* (albeit with challenges).\n-   **Citation Density**: The \"Policy Window\" section makes specific claims about future EU mandates with sparse evidence.\n\n**RECOMMENDED PAPERS**:\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.3990/4.2535-5686.2019.07 | Reason: Salomaa & Charles (2019) explicitly discuss the \"Third Mission\" in peripheral regions, providing the nuance missing from your \"Bohr\" critique.\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.1080/21681376.2019.1586574 | Reason: Salomaa (2019) on \"Third mission and regional context\" to support the discussion on institutional barriers.\nRECOMMEND SEARCH: \"European Association of Research and Technology Organisations (EARTO)\" | Reason: To validate the standard terminology \"RTO\" over \"ARO\".\n\n**SPECIFIC EDITS**:\n-   **Global**: Replace \"ARO\" with \"RTO\" (Research and Technology Organisation) throughout the text to align with EU policy standards.\n-   **Section: The Innovation Paradox**:\n    -   *Issue*: The claim that universities are purely \"Bohr\" is too absolute.\n    -   *Suggestion*: Acknowledge the \"Third Mission\" but argue it is insufficient in *fragile* regions due to resource constraints, citing `Salomaa & Charles (2019)`.\n-   **Section: Smart Specialization 2.0**:\n    -   *Issue*: Citation `@10_years_of_coo_Szavic_2025` is missing/invalid.\n    -   *Suggestion*: Replace with a valid reference on Smart Specialization evolution (e.g., works by Dominique Foray or the cited `Barzotto_2020`).\n-   **Section: The Living Lab Approach**:\n    -   *Issue*: Citation `@Gwiazdzinska2022` is missing/invalid.\n    -   *Suggestion*: Replace with a standard Living Lab reference (e.g., papers by Schuurman or Leminen) or remove the specific attribution."
