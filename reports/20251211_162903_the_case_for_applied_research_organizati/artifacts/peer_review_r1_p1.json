It effectively critiques existing governance models (academic and consultancy) and proposes a mission-oriented, place-based alternative. The theoretical framework linking Stokes\u2019 quadrants to regional innovation policy is innovative and relevant to the \"geography of discontent.\" However, the document suffers from missing bibliographic entries, non-standard terminology, and areas of low citation density that require attention to meet rigorous academic standards.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n-   **Theoretical Innovation**: The application of Stokes\u2019 \"Pasteur\u2019s Quadrant\" to define a new organizational typology for regional governance is a strong, original contribution.\n-   **Policy Relevance**: The paper is highly timely, directly addressing the upcoming FP10 mandate and the specific context of \"left-behind\" places.\n-   **Structural Logic**: The argument flows logically from problem definition (fragility) to theoretical solution (ARO model) to operationalization (Living Labs).\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n-   **Missing Bibliography Entries**: Two key citations in the text (`@10_years_of_coo_Szavic_2025` and `@Gwiazdzinska2022`) are missing from the provided bibliography.\n-   **Non-Standard Terminology**: The term \"ARO\" (Applied Research Organization) is used, whereas the standard European policy term is \"RTO\" (Research and Technology Organisation). Unless \"ARO\" is a specific new term in the FP10 draft, using \"RTO\" would increase policy resonance.\n-   **Citation Density**: Several key paragraphs, particularly in the \"Policy Window\" and \"Fragility Trap\" sections, rely on single citations or lack support for specific claims.\n-   **University \"Third Mission\" Oversight**: The critique of universities (Bohr model) overlooks the extensive literature on the \"Third Mission\" (universities engaging with society). The argument would be stronger if it acknowledged this but explained why it remains insufficient for *peripheral* regions.\n\n**RECOMMENDED PAPERS**:\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.15544/rd.2019.068 | Reason: Replaces missing Living Lab citation with \"LIVING LABS \u2013 INNOVATE BUSINESS MODELS FOR RURAL REGIONS\" (Gr\u00fcneis et al. 2020).\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.18335/region.v9i2.388 | Reason: Supports the \"Fragility Trap\" section with specific evidence on Smart Specialization in less-developed regions (Wibisono 2022).\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.1080/00343404.2018.1530753 | Reason: Provides evidence for the \"Green Windows\" section regarding green path development in regions (T\u00f6dtling et al. 2019 or similar).\n\n**SPECIFIC EDITS**:\n\n**Section: Introduction**\n-   **Issue**: Para 3 (\"This paper argues...\") lacks citations defining the \"Pasteur's Quadrant\" in an organizational context.\n-   **Suggestion**: Add `@Research_and_Te_Sheikh_2021` here to ground the \"super-intermediary\" concept early on.\n\n**Section: The Fragility Trap**\n-   **Issue**: Para 1 has only 1 citation.\n-   **Suggestion**: Add `@The_Geography_o_Rodrig_2024` again or `@Left_behind_pl_Pike_2024` to reinforce the governance crisis claim.\n\n**Section: The Case for Pasteur\u2019s Quadrant AROs**\n-   **Issue**: Terminology \"ARO\".\n-   **Suggestion**: Consider changing \"ARO\" to \"RTO\" (Research and Technology Organisation) or explicitly stating: \"We term these entities Applied Research Organizations (AROs), distinct from standard RTOs by their specific focus on territorial governance...\"\n\n**Section: The Policy Window**\n-   **Issue**: \"Smart Specialization 2.0\" citation `@10_years_of_coo_Szavic_2025` is missing.\n-   **Suggestion**: Replace with `@Smart_specialis_Barzot_2020` or the recommended `Wibisono 2022`.\n\n**Section: Operationalizing the Model**\n-   **Issue**: \"Living Lab\" citation `@Gwiazdzinska2022` is missing.\n-   **Suggestion**: Replace with `Gr\u00fcneis et al. 2020` (DOI: 10.15544/rd.2019.068).\n\n**Section: Conclusion**\n-   **Issue**: No citations.\n-   **Suggestion**: While acceptable, referencing `@Mission_oriente_Mazzuc_2018` again when mentioning \"mission\" would strengthen the final link to EU policy."
