    "To what extent does the EU 2028-2034 mandate's focus on applied innovation create a policy window for establishing mission-oriented AROs in peripheral regions?",
    "How does the current deficit in territorial governance exacerbate fragility in rural landscapes that have undergone demographic shifts?",
    "In what ways does the 'Pasteur Quadrant' model (high utility/high fundamental knowledge) offer a superior mechanism for territorial resilience compared to traditional academic or consultancy models?",
    "What emergent case studies of place-based innovation organizations demonstrate the operational viability of AROs in addressing spatial inequality?"
