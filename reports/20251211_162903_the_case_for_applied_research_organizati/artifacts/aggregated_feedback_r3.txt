**Summary**: {'answer': 'Question: What are the key findings of the paper with DOI 10.1080/09654313.2016.1174670?\n\nThe paper with DOI 10.1080/09654313.2016.1174670 identifies three primary lessons learned from its case studies on Smart Specialization Strategies (RIS3) in the Basque Country (estensoro2016overcomingpolicymaking pages 1-3). Firstly, it emphasizes the critical need to cultivate connections between regional and sub-regional governments to establish networks of territorial actors, which serve as essential information sources for governmental bodies (estensoro2016overcomingpolicymaking pages 1-3). Secondly, the study highlights the substantial challenge associated with effectively managing the complexity and conflict inherent in RIS3 implementation (estensoro2016overcomingpolicymaking pages 1-3). Lastly, it underscores the vital importance of integrating social researchers into RIS3 processes to improve both their design and execution (estensoro2016overcomingpolicymaking pages 1-3).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

**Summary**: {'answer': "Question: What are the key findings of the paper with DOI 10.1080/21681376.2019.1586574?\n\nThe paper with DOI 10.1080/21681376.2019.1586574, based on a case study of the University of Lincoln in a rural UK region, identifies several key findings regarding universities' 'third mission' activities. Universities in such rural contexts experience elevated expectations to spearhead regional development due to a scarcity of other local knowledge institutions (salomaa2019thirdmissionand pages 1-3). Engagement in these activities predominantly occurs through personal connections rather than formal institutional mechanisms (salomaa2019thirdmissionand pages 1-3). Furthermore, university structures and strategic orientations are adapted to cater to the local job market and regional priority sectors (salomaa2019thirdmissionand pages 1-3). These findings collectively demonstrate that a specific regional context profoundly influences a university's approach and institutional responses to 'third mission' activities, underscoring the necessity for context-sensitive research in this domain (salomaa2019thirdmissionand pages 1-3).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

--- REVIEWER 1 (major_revisions) ---
Summary: This paper presents a theoretically innovative argument for institutionalizing "Pasteur’s Quadrant" organizations to address territorial fragility in the EU's 2028-2034 framework. The application of Stokes’ model to regional innovation policy is a strong conceptual contribution. However, the manuscript fails to meet rigorous academic standards due to the **persistence of hallucinated citations** despite previous feedback, the continued use of non-standard terminology ("ARO" vs "RTO") which creates policy friction, and a failure to engage with the extensive "Third Mission" literature. The critique of universities remains a strawman argument that weakens the paper's credibility. These issues must be resolved before publication.
Weaknesses: -   **Hallucinated Citations**: The citations `@10_years_of_coo_Szavic_2025` and `@Gwiazdzinska2022` are missing from the bibliography and appear to be hallucinations. This is a serious breach of academic rigor. They must be replaced with real, verifiable literature.
-   **Strawman Argument against Universities**: The paper argues that universities are purely "Bohr" (fundamental research) and incapable of local engagement. This ignores the vast literature on the "Third Mission" (universities engaging with society). Acknowledging that universities *attempt* this but often fail in peripheral regions due to specific incentives would make the argument more nuanced and robust.
-   **Non-Standard Terminology**: The persistence of "ARO" (Applied Research Organization) instead of the standard European term **RTO** (Research and Technology Organisation) is problematic. EARTO is the recognized body; using "ARO" suggests a lack of familiarity with the actual policy landscape.
-   **Citation Density**: The "Policy Window" and "Fragility Trap" sections make broad claims about future EU mandates and regional paradoxes with insufficient evidentiary support.
