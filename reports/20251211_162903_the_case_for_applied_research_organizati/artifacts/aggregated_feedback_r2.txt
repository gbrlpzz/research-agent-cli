**Summary**: {'answer': "Question: What are the key findings of the paper with DOI 10.1080/21681376.2019.1586574?\n\nThe key findings of the paper with DOI 10.1080/21681376.2019.1586574, based on a case study of the University of Lincoln in a rural UK region, are as follows: Universities situated in rural contexts face heightened expectations to lead regional development, primarily due to a lack of other local knowledge institutions (salomaa2019thirdmissionand pages 1-3). Engagement in these settings predominantly relies on personal connections rather than formal mechanisms (salomaa2019thirdmissionand pages 1-3). Furthermore, university structures and strategies are specifically tailored to serve the local job market and regional priority sectors (salomaa2019thirdmissionand pages 1-3). These results indicate that a specific regional context significantly shapes a university's approach and institutional responses to 'third mission' activities, highlighting the need for context-sensitive studies (salomaa2019thirdmissionand pages 1-3). The 'third mission' refers to a university's activities related to knowledge transfer, engagement, and societal impact, beyond its primary functions of teaching and research.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

--- REVIEWER 1 (major_revisions) ---
Summary: This paper presents a forward-looking argument for establishing "Pasteur’s Quadrant" organizations to address territorial fragility in the EU's upcoming FP10 framework. The theoretical application of Stokes’ model to regional innovation policy is original and compelling. However, the document fails to meet academic standards due to **persistent missing citations** (which appear to be hallucinations), the use of non-standard terminology ("ARO" vs "RTO"), and a failure to engage with the extensive "Third Mission" literature, creating a strawman argument against universities. These issues must be resolved before publication.
Weaknesses: -   **Missing/Hallucinated Citations**: The citations `@10_years_of_coo_Szavic_2025` and `@Gwiazdzinska2022` remain missing from the bibliography. Furthermore, searches suggest these papers may not exist. You must either provide the DOIs or replace them with valid references.
-   **Non-Standard Terminology**: The paper persists in using "ARO" (Applied Research Organization). The standard European term is **RTO** (Research and Technology Organisation), represented by EARTO. Using "ARO" creates unnecessary friction for policy readers.
-   **Strawman Argument against Universities**: The critique of universities as purely "Bohr" (fundamental research) ignores the vast literature on the "Third Mission" (regional engagement). You argue universities *cannot* do this, but literature shows they *do* (albeit with challenges).
-   **Citation Density**: The "Policy Window" section makes specific claims about future EU mandates with sparse evidence.
