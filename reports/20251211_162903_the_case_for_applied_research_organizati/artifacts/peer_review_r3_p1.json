  "full_text": "**VERDICT**: Major Revisions\n\n**SUMMARY**:\nThis paper presents a theoretically innovative argument for institutionalizing \"Pasteur\u2019s Quadrant\" organizations to address territorial fragility in the EU's 2028-2034 framework. The application of Stokes\u2019 model to regional innovation policy is a strong conceptual contribution. However, the manuscript fails to meet rigorous academic standards due to the **persistence of hallucinated citations** despite previous feedback, the continued use of non-standard terminology (\"ARO\" vs \"RTO\") which creates policy friction, and a failure to engage with the extensive \"Third Mission\" literature. The critique of universities remains a strawman argument that weakens the paper's credibility. These issues must be resolved before publication.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n-   **Theoretical Framework**: The adaptation of Stokes\u2019 \"Pasteur\u2019s Quadrant\" to territorial governance is original and provides a clear heuristic for distinguishing the proposed organizations from traditional universities and consultancies.\n-   **Policy Relevance**: The paper is well-timed for the discussions surrounding the EU's Framework Programme 10 (FP10) and effectively links territorial fragility to the \"geography of discontent.\"\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n-   **Hallucinated Citations**: The citations `@10_years_of_coo_Szavic_2025` and `@Gwiazdzinska2022` are missing from the bibliography and appear to be hallucinations. This is a serious breach of academic rigor. They must be replaced with real, verifiable literature.\n-   **Strawman Argument against Universities**: The paper argues that universities are purely \"Bohr\" (fundamental research) and incapable of local engagement. This ignores the vast literature on the \"Third Mission\" (universities engaging with society). Acknowledging that universities *attempt* this but often fail in peripheral regions due to specific incentives would make the argument more nuanced and robust.\n-   **Non-Standard Terminology**: The persistence of \"ARO\" (Applied Research Organization) instead of the standard European term **RTO** (Research and Technology Organisation) is problematic.

(2019) regarding Living Labs in rural contexts.\n\nSection: Advantages over Bohr and Edison Models\nIssue: Critique of universities ignores \"Third Mission\".\nSuggestion: Insert a sentence acknowledging the \"Third Mission\" (cite Salomaa, 2019) but argue that in peripheral regions, global academic incentives often overpower local engagement needs.\n\nSection: Throughout Document\nIssue: Use of \"ARO\".\nSuggestion: Replace \"ARO\" with \"RTO\" (Research and Technology Organisation) or explicitly define ARO as a distinct subset of RTOs to align with EU terminology."
