  "sub_questions": [
    "How is 'territorial fragility' currently conceptualized in EU cohesion policy and how does it intersect with the 'geographies of discontent' literature?",
    "What specific mechanisms allow applied research organisations to drive place-based innovation in lagging regions compared to traditional academic institutions?",
    "To what extent do current foresight documents for FP10 and the post-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework emphasize territorial equity over pure excellence-based funding?",
    "How can mission-oriented research policies be adapted in the 2028-2034 programming to specifically target the socio-economic resilience of fragile EU territories?"
