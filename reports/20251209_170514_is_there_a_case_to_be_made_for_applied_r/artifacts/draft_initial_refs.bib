  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Research and technology organizations (RTOs) are studied in the innovation policy literature mainly as providers of R\&amp;D services and as intermediaries between universities and the private sector. Through the case of the Institut National d’Optique (INO), Canada’s leading RTO in the optics and photonics industry, we argue that RTOs can also act as entrepreneurs by generating technologies and commercializing them through licensing, technology transfers and spin-offs. By analyzing the broad range of activities undertaken by INO, we also discuss what characteristics make some RTOs more likely to embrace entrepreneurship than others. Those characteristics include the following: renewed access to government funding to build a strong in-house research infrastructure and scientific workforce; strategic R\&amp;D planning that incorporates commercial objectives and an environment that encourages a culture of entrepreneurship among employees; the ability to act as the driving force of a network of academic, government and private sector organizations. From a policy perspective, the INO case indicates that the main value of using RTOs as entrepreneurship instruments does not lie in profitability but rather in developing dynamic regional systems of innovation.</jats:p>},

system that effectively supports sustainable development goals,
involving public development finance institutions and a blended
finance system that integrates public resources with private

  abstract = {<jats:p> The promotion of innovation-driven development in lagging regions is currently on the regional policy agenda, so a sound understanding of how learning and innovation can be successful under the conditions there is crucial. In this context, this paper demonstrates the potential of an innovation mode approach at the micro level of regional innovation systems. Based on a conceptual framework on the relationship between knowledge bases and innovation modes in the field of regional development, a systematic literature review is used to analyze whether this potential has already been exploited in previous innovation studies on lagging regions. The results show that some important steps have already been taken in this direction. However, the potential gains in terms of a better understanding of innovation in lagging regions have so far been limited. Against this background, the authors identify several avenues for future research. </jats:p>},

@article{Between_policy_Jubany_2025,
  abstract = {<ns5:p>Background Long-standing territorial disparities have evolved into novel forms of inequality, exacerbated by a decline in social status and the protection afforded to citizens. Territorial inequality extends beyond economic disparities in income and wealth, encompassing unequal access to fundamental rights and opportunities such as essential services, infrastructure, and education. These disparities pose significant challenges to comprehensive socioeconomic development. This paper is part of a broader research project on \textquotedblleft left-behindness,\textquotedblright  aiming to explore stakeholders\textquotesingle  perceptions of the underlying drivers of territorial inequalities, as well as the governance mechanisms and policy tools aimed at mitigating these issues. Methods The analysis draws on data from 20 focus groups conducted between November and December 2023, involving 98 national, regional and local stakeholders from seven European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Serbia, and Spain. Results The findings reveal a notable disconnect between national-level discourses on territorial inequalities and the priorities of local and regional stakeholders across the seven countries. While territorial disparities are acknowledged within policy frameworks, efforts to address these issues are often impeded by governance challenges, including tensions between centralization and decentralization, fragmented coordination, and insufficient horizontal and vertical cooperation among actors at different levels of government. Conclusions The research underscores the necessity of adopting place-sensitive, context-specific approaches to address territorial inequalities. It highlights the need to address demographic challenges, geographic isolation, and inequitable funding mechanisms, particularly in underserved regions. Aligning policy interventions with the diverse and context-dependent challenges faced by \textquotedblleft left-behind\textquotedblright  areas is essential for the effective mitigation of territorial disparities.</ns5:p>},
