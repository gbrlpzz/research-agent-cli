    "To what extent does the current EU territorial governance framework fail to align with the demographic reality of completed urbanization, specifically regarding 'left-behind' or fragile rural territories?",
    "How do AROs differ from traditional academic bodies in their capacity to generate high-utility, high-knowledge solutions (Pasteur's Quadrant) for spatial justice and regional resilience?",
    "What characterizes the emergent 'state of the art' in existing applied research initiatives tackling territorial fragility, and what success factors can be extrapolated?",
    "How can the EU 2028-2034 innovation agenda specifically incorporate AROs as strategic intermediaries to transform territorial governance?"
