**Summary**: {'answer': 'Question: What are the key findings of the paper with DOI 10.1108/EJMBE-07-2017-011?\n\nThe key finding of the paper with DOI 10.1108/EJMBE-07-2017-011 is that technological policy must account for the unique characteristics of each region to establish more efficient and equitable mechanisms (augusto2017researchandtechnology pages 1-2). This approach enables Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) to effectively address new challenges (augusto2017researchandtechnology pages 1-2). The study proposes a theoretical model for RTOs to respond to environmental changes and globalization (augusto2017researchandtechnology pages 1-2). This model posits that RTOs must manage an optimal combination of key factors, specifically developing more proactive innovation strategies and adopting an organic organizational structure (augusto2017researchandtechnology pages 1-2). Such an approach facilitates improved relationships with other innovation agents and universities, enhances efficiency in collaborations with Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), and ultimately leads to higher innovative performance (augusto2017researchandtechnology pages 1-2).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

[End of New Literature]

--- REVIEWER 1 (major_revisions) ---
Summary: This paper addresses a critical and under-researched area: the specific role of Applied Research Organizations (AROs/RTOs) in "fragile" or peripheral territories. It successfully argues that the standard "technology transfer" model is ill-suited for regions with low absorptive capacity and proposes a shift towards "capacity building" and "system integration." The theoretical framework using the "Regional Innovation Paradox" and "institutional voids" is sound. However, the paper currently fails to meet the rigorous academic standard for citation density (multiple paragraphs have 0-1 citations) and misses key literature specifically analyzing RTO strategies in peripheral contexts.
Weaknesses: - **Citation Density**: The document falls significantly short of the required citation density. Several paragraphs, particularly in the "RTOs as System Integrators" and "Policy and Funding Implications" sections, contain zero or only one citation.
- **Literature Coverage**: While general regional innovation literature is cited (Trippl, Morgan), the paper misses specific studies on RTO management in peripheral regions (e.g., work by Albors-Garrigos, Mayer, or Isaksen) which would empirically support the "system integrator" claims.
- **Generic Funding Argument**: The critique of "New Public Management" (NPM) is plausible but lacks specific references connecting NPM reforms directly to RTO performance in peripheral areas.
