The use of the \"Regional Innovation Paradox\" and \"institutional voids\" provides a solid conceptual basis. However, the manuscript **fails to address critical feedback from the previous round**. Specifically, it still lacks the requested key literature (Albors-Garrigos, Mayer, Isaksen) that empirically grounds RTO strategies in peripheral regions. Furthermore, citation density remains below academic standards in key sections.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n-   **Theoretical Framework**: The application of Oughton\u2019s \"Regional Innovation Paradox\" to the specific context of RTOs is logical and well-argued.\n-   **Conceptual Clarity**: The distinction between \"technology push\" and \"capacity building\" is clearly defined and central to the paper's contribution.\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n-   **Missing Key Literature (Critical)**: The previous review explicitly requested the inclusion of work by **Albors-Garrigos**, **Mayer**, and **Isaksen**. These authors are foundational to the study of RTOs and innovation in peripheral regions. Their absence makes the paper feel theoretically detached from the core empirical literature in this niche.\n-   **Citation Density**: The \"RTOs as System Integrators\" and \"Policy and Funding Implications\" sections contain paragraphs with zero or only one citation. This is insufficient for verifying claims about RTO operational models and funding biases.\n-   **Generic Funding Critique**: The claim that New Public Management (NPM) specifically disadvantages *peripheral* RTOs relies on Loikkanen (2011), which is a general study of Finnish PROs. A more specific reference connecting funding metrics to peripheral disadvantage is needed.\n\n**RECOMMENDED PAPERS**:\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-9310.2010.00611.x | Reason: Albors-Garrigos (2010) explicitly analyzes RTO management paradigms in regional contexts.\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.1080/09537325.2013.850159 | Reason: Albors-Garrigos et al. (2014) provides empirical evidence on RTOs leading collaboration with SMEs.\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.1553/0x003b582d | Reason: Mayer (2020) \"Slow Innovation\" offers a critical counter-narrative to \"acceleration\" suited for peripheral regions.\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.4337/9781784710774.00030 | Reason: Isaksen & Karlsen (2016) is a seminal text on innovation modes in peripheral regions.\n\n**SPECIFIC EDITS**:\n-   **Section: RTOs as System Integrators**\n    -   *Issue*: The first paragraph makes strong claims about RTOs compensating for institutional voids but has **zero citations**.\n    -   *Suggestion*: Cite **Albors-Garrigos (2014)** here to support the claim of RTOs acting as intermediaries/leaders for SMEs.\n-   **Section: Policy and Funding Implications**\n    -   *Issue*: The critique of funding models is too generic.\n    -   *Suggestion*: Incorporate **Isaksen et al. (2017)** (\"Do general innovation policy tools fit all?\") to empirically support the argument that \"blind\" policy tools fail in peripheral contexts.\n-   **Section: Introduction**\n    -   *Issue*: Paragraph 2 has only 1 citation.\n    -   *Suggestion*: Add **Mayer (2020)** to contrast the \"advanced industrial region\" models with peripheral realities."
