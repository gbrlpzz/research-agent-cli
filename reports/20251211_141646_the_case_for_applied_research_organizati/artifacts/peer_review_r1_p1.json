  "full_text": "**VERDICT**: Major Revisions\n\n**SUMMARY**:\nThis paper addresses a critical and under-researched area: the specific role of Applied Research Organizations (AROs/RTOs) in \"fragile\" or peripheral territories. It successfully argues that the standard \"technology transfer\" model is ill-suited for regions with low absorptive capacity and proposes a shift towards \"capacity building\" and \"system integration.\" The theoretical framework using the \"Regional Innovation Paradox\" and \"institutional voids\" is sound. However, the paper currently fails to meet the rigorous academic standard for citation density (multiple paragraphs have 0-1 citations) and misses key literature specifically analyzing RTO strategies in peripheral contexts.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n- **Conceptual Clarity**: The distinction between \"technology push\" (standard RTO model) and \"capacity building\" (needed model) is well-articulated and theoretically grounded.\n- **Relevance**: The focus on \"institutional voids\" and \"lock-in\" effectively explains why standard innovation policies fail in these regions.\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n- **Citation Density**: The document falls significantly short of the required citation density. Several paragraphs, particularly in the \"RTOs as System Integrators\" and \"Policy and Funding Implications\" sections, contain zero or only one citation.\n- **Literature Coverage**: While general regional innovation literature is cited (Trippl, Morgan), the paper misses specific studies on RTO management in peripheral regions (e.g., work by Albors-Garrigos, Mayer, or Isaksen) which would empirically support the \"system integrator\" claims.\n- **Generic Funding Argument**: The critique of \"New Public Management\" (NPM) is plausible but lacks specific references connecting NPM reforms directly to RTO performance in peripheral areas.\n\n**RECOMMENDED PAPERS**:\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.1553/0x003b582d | Reason: Mayer (2020) \"Slow Innovation in Europe\u2019s Peripheral Regions\" provides essential context on how peripheral innovation differs from the \"fast\" urban models RTOs usually serve.\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-9310.2010.00611.x | Reason: Albors-Garrigos et al. (2010) directly analyze RTO strategies and their role in regional development, supporting the \"system integrator\" argument.\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.1108/EJMBE-07-2017-011 | Reason: Diaz & Garrigos (2017) provide empirical evidence of RTOs acting as \"mobilizers\" of the regional environment.\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.11113/jostip.v1n2.11 | Reason: Ariffin et al. (2015) specifically discuss the challenges of corporatization (NPM) for RTOs, supporting the funding mismatch section.\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.4337/9781784710774.00030 | Reason: Isaksen & Karlsen (2016) is a foundational text on \"Innovation in peripheral regions\" that should be cited in the introduction.\n\n**SPECIFIC EDITS**:\n\n**Section: Introduction**\n- **Issue**: Paragraph 1 and 2 have low citation density (<3).\n- **Suggestion**: Add **Isaksen & Karlsen (2016)** to the definition of fragile/peripheral regions. Add **Mayer (2020)** when discussing the difference between metropolitan and fragile contexts.\n\n**Section: RTOs as System Integrators**\n- **Issue**: The first paragraph has **zero** citations.\n- **Suggestion**: This is a key claim. Cite **Albors-Garrigos et al. (2010)** or **Diaz & Garrigos (2017)** to support the idea that RTOs can and do act as system integrators/mobilizers.\n\n**Section: Policy and Funding Implications**\n- **Issue**: The section on \"The Funding Mismatch\" relies heavily on Loikkanen (2011).\n- **Suggestion**: Strengthen the \"New Public Management\" argument by citing **Ariffin et al. (2015)** or **Schubert et al. (2024)** (DOI: 10.1093/reseval/rvaf015) to show how performance metrics specifically harm non-commercial mandates.\n\n**Section: Conclusion**\n- **Issue**: No citations in the conclusion.\n- **Suggestion**: While conclusions often summarize, it is best practice to reference the key framework authors (e.g., \"As **Oughton (2002)** predicted...\") to reinforce the argument's lineage."
