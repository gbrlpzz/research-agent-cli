  abstract: [
    As the European Union approaches its next research framework (FP10, 2028-2034), the challenge of 'territorial fragility' in post-urban landscapes remains acute. This paper argues for the strategic deployment of Applied Research Organisations (AROs) operating in 'Pasteur's Quadrant'\u2014combining high utility with fundamental understanding\u2014to address the governance deficits in these regions. We analyse the limitations of current cohesion policies, including Smart Specialisation (RIS3), which often flounder in "left-behind" places due to low absorptive capacity. We propose that mission-oriented AROs can serve as vital intermediaries to overcome the "Regional Innovation Paradox." By acting as entrepreneurship instruments and knowledge anchors, these organisations can translate the high-level objectives of the EU's innovation mandate into place-based resilience, filling the institutional void in fragile territories.

= Introduction
The demographic transition towards urbanisation in the European Union is largely complete, yet the territorial governance structures required to manage the resulting "post-urban" landscapes remain underdeveloped or maladapted. This lag has created a condition of *territorial fragility*, particularly in what are increasingly termed "left-behind places" or "inner peripheries" @Left_behind_pl_Pike_2024. These regions face a dual crisis: a loss of economic vitality and a deficit in strategic governance capacity @From_Territoria_Jones_2020.

As the EU prepares its 10th Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (FP10) for the period 2028-2034, there is a distinct policy window to reimagine how research infrastructure supports regional cohesion. Early indications suggest the new mandate will double down on mission-oriented innovation with a strong emphasis on competitiveness and impact @A_view_of_Horiz_Borrel_2025. However, without specific institutional mechanisms to ground these missions in fragile territories, the risk of exacerbating spatial inequalities remains high @Regioning_missi_Priebe_2024.

This paper presents a conceptual analysis based on a synthesis of economic geography and innovation management literature. We argue that Applied Research Organisations (AROs) structured around "Pasteur's Quadrant"\u2014use-inspired basic research\u2014offer a compelling solution. Unlike traditional linear models of innovation, AROs can act as "super intermediaries" @Research_and_Te_Sheikh_2021, bridging the gap between high-level EU mandates and local implementation.

= The Challenge: Fragility and the Innovation Paradox
Territorial fragility in the EU is not merely a matter of low GDP; it is a structural condition defined by "entrenched economic underperformance, socio-economic inequalities, and a spatialized narrative of failure" @From_Territoria_Jones_2020. These "left-behind places" are often characterized by a "governance gap" where local institutions lack the capacity to engage strategically with global markets or EU funding streams @Discontent_and_Bernar_2025.

Current governance models, particularly "Territorial Cohesion" and Smart Specialisation Strategies (RIS3), have struggled to reverse this trend. While RIS3 aims to prioritize regional strengths, it often fails in lagging regions due to the **"Regional Innovation Paradox"**: the regions with the greatest need for innovation policy are those with the lowest capacity to absorb public funds and design effective strategies @An_empirical_te_Muscio_2015. Papamichail et al. (2022) highlight that without robust institutional capacity to manage the "entrepreneurial discovery process," RIS3 becomes a bureaucratic exercise rather than a driver of growth @Addressing_Publ_Papami_2022.

Furthermore, the administrative boundaries (NUTS2) used for governance often cut across functional economic areas, fragmenting potential development strategies @From_Territoria_Jones_2020. This "institutional emptiness" leaves fragile territories vulnerable to external shocks and unable to leverage innovation effectively.

= The ARO Model: Pasteur's Quadrant
To address this gap, we propose the establishment or reinforcement of AROs modeled on "Pasteur's Quadrant." Originally defined by Donald Stokes and recently reconsidered by Pettigrew and Cooke (2022), this concept describes research that simultaneously seeks fundamental understanding and immediate utility @At_the_nexus_of_Pettig_2022.

In the context of territorial governance, AROs function differently from traditional universities (basic research) or commercial consultancies (purely applied). They occupy the "use-inspired basic research" quadrant, allowing them to:
1.  **Generate deep knowledge** about specific territorial problems (e.g., climate resilience in rural areas).
2.  **Develop practical solutions** that are immediately applicable to local stakeholders.
3.  **Act as anchors**, providing a stable institutional presence that attracts talent and investment @Research_and_te_Khelfa_2023.

Crucially, AROs act as **"super intermediaries"**, operating on two axes: vertically, connecting EU-level missions to local contexts; and horizontally, linking public research with private enterprise @Research_and_Te_Sheikh_2021. This distinguishes them from standard RIS3 implementations, which often lack a dedicated "engine" to drive the strategy.

**Addressing Absorptive Capacity:** A critical counter-argument is that fragile regions lack the human capital to staff such high-level organisations\u2014the risk of creating "cathedrals in the desert." However, evidence suggests that AROs can themselves be the solution to this absorptive capacity problem. By offering stable, mission-driven employment, they can attract talent back to peripheral regions. Khelfaoui and Bernier (2023) demonstrate that Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) can act as "entrepreneurship instruments," spinning off companies and effectively *creating* the absorptive capacity the region initially lacked @Research_and_te_Khelfa_2023.

= Realigning with the EU 2028-2034 Mandate
The emerging strategic orientation for FP10 (2028-2034) emphasises "mission-oriented" policies to solve grand societal challenges @A_view_of_Horiz_Borrel_2025. However, mission-oriented policies often suffer from a "directionality" problem: they are set at the top level but fail to land effectively in specific regional contexts @Regioning_missi_Priebe_2024.

AROs are uniquely positioned to address this "last mile" translation problem. By embedding themselves in fragile territories, they can "region" national or EU-level missions, translating abstract goals (e.g., the Green Deal) into concrete local projects @Regioning_missi_Priebe_2024. For example, Loikkanen et al. (2011) highlight how the placement of VTT technical research units in Finland was used as a deliberate regional development tool, effectively creating innovation clusters in non-capital regions @Public_Research_Loikka_2011.

**Funding the Anchor:** For the 2028-2034 period, the EU must recognise that competitive funding alone (e.g., Horizon Europe grants) will fail in fragile territories due to the Innovation Paradox. To function as infrastructure for cohesion, AROs in these regions require **core institutional funding**. This creates the stability needed to recruit talent and maintain long-term research agendas in Pasteur's Quadrant, decoupled from short-term market cycles or the volatility of competitive grant-seeking.

= Conclusion
The persistence of territorial fragility in the EU suggests that current governance mechanisms are insufficient. As the Union moves towards the 2028-2034 research mandate, there is a compelling case to be made for Applied Research Organisations as key agents of change. By operating in Pasteur's Quadrant, AROs can provide the "high utility plus high contribution to knowledge" required to transform fragile territories from passive recipients of aid into active laboratories of resilience. Future research should focus on designing the specific legal, financial, and *capacity-building* frameworks needed to sustain these organisations in the most vulnerable regions.
