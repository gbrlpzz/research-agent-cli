# Peer Review - Round 1

**Verdict**: MINOR_REVISIONS

Here is a structured peer review of the document.

### 1. Overall Assessment
**Status: MINOR REVISIONS**

The document presents a cogent, well-argued case for the strategic positioning of Applied Research Organisations (AROs) within the upcoming EU FP10 framework. The synthesis of "territorial fragility" literature (Jones, Pike) with innovation management concepts (Pasteur’s Quadrant, AROs) is novel and theoretically sound. The draft meets the requirements of the research plan and answers the posed questions. However, the argument lacks critical reflection on the *absorptive capacity* of fragile regions to host such high-level institutions, and it glosses over existing mechanisms (like Smart Specialisation) that occupy similar policy spaces.

### 2. Strengths
*   **Theoretical Synthesis**: The paper successfully bridges two distinct bodies of literature: economic geography (territorial fragility/left-behind places) and research policy (Pasteur’s Quadrant/intermediary organisations). This interdisciplinary approach is the document's strongest asset.
*   **Relevance to Mandate**: The focus on the specific window of the 2028-2034 mandate (FP10) and the integration of very recent sources (Borrell-Damian 2025, Priebe 2024) makes the argument highly timely and policy-relevant.
*   **Clear Definition of ARO Utility**: The application of the "Pasteur's Quadrant" model to territorial governance is well-articulated, moving beyond generic calls for "more innovation" to specify the *type* of research needed (use-inspired basic).

### 3. Critical Issues
*   **The "Absorptive Capacity" Paradox**: The paper argues that AROs should be placed in "fragile territories" to fix governance gaps. However, it fails to address the counter-argument: fragile territories often lack the human capital and infrastructure to support a high-functioning ARO. If the ARO functions as an "anchor," where does the talent come from? Does it become an "ivory tower" in a desert? This limitation must be acknowledged.
*   **Lack of Differentiation from S3/S4**: The EU currently uses Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3) to attempt exactly what this paper proposes (place-based innovation). The paper criticises "Cohesion Policy" generally but does not explicitly distinguish how the ARO model differs from or improves upon the existing S3 framework. This is a significant gap in the policy context.

### 4. Suggestions
*   **Strengthen the Funding Argument**: The recommendation to shift from project-based to core funding is crucial. You should briefly mention the tension this creates with EU State Aid rules or competitive funding norms in Horizon Europe. How feasible is "core funding" under current EU regulations?
*   **Clarify "Super Intermediaries"**: While referencing Sheikh (2021), elaborate slightly on *who* the ARO mediates between. Is it strictly EU-Local, or also Public-Private? The "entrepreneurship instrument" claim (Khelfaoui 2023) suggests the latter, but the text focuses on the former.
*   **Methodological Note**: While this is a position paper, a brief sentence explaining that this is a conceptual analysis based on literature synthesis would strengthen the introduction.

### 5. Missing Content
*   **Smart Specialisation Strategies (RIS3)**: A reference to why current RIS3 approaches have failed to address "left-behind places" would strengthen the case for AROs.
*   **Human Capital**: A brief acknowledgement of the difficulty in recruiting researchers to "inner peripheries."

### 6. Specific Line Edits

*   **Introduction, Paragraph 1**:
    *   *Current*: "...governance structures required to manage the resulting 'post-urban' landscapes remain underdeveloped."
    *   *Edit*: Change to "...remain underdeveloped or maladapted." (Underdeveloped implies they don't exist; maladapted implies they exist but are wrong for the context, which fits Jones 2020 better).
*   **The ARO Model, Paragraph 2**:
    *   *Current*: "They sit in the 'use-inspired basic research' quadrant..."
    *   *Edit*: "They occupy the 'use-inspired basic research' quadrant..." (More formal).
*   **Realigning with the EU Mandate, Paragraph 2**:
    *   *Current*: "AROs are uniquely positioned to solve this 'last mile' problem."
    *   *Edit*: "AROs are uniquely positioned to address this 'last mile' translation problem." (Clarifies the nature of the problem).
*   **Conclusion, Final Sentence**:
    *   *Current*: "...designing the specific legal and financial frameworks..."
    *   *Edit*: "...designing the specific legal, financial, and *capacity-building* frameworks..." (Acknowledges the human capital constraint).

### Citation Check
*   **Compliance**: 9/9 Citations from the provided bibliography are used in the text.
*   **Accuracy**:
    *   `@Left_behind_pl_Pike_2024` is correctly used to define "left-behind places."
    *   `@From_Territoria_Jones_2020` is heavily relied upon for the problem definition; this is appropriate as it is a seminal text for this specific argument.
    *   `@Public_Research_Loikka_2011` is correctly used as an empirical example (VTT Finland).
    *   `@A_view_of_Horiz_Borrel_2025` is correctly used for the forward-looking FP10 context.
*   **Formatting**: Typst syntax is correct.
