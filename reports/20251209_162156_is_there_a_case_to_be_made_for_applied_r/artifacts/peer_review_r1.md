# STRUCTURED REVIEW

**Title:** Institutionalizing Innovation for Territorial Fragility: The Case for AROs in the EU 2028-2034 Framework
**Date:** December 2025
**Reviewer Decision:** **MAJOR REVISIONS**

## 1. Overall Assessment
The paper presents a timely and logically structured argument positioning Applied Research Organisations (AROs) as a solution to the "governance gap" in the EU's fragile territories. The synthesis of "Pasteur’s Quadrant" with "left-behind places" literature is theoretically compelling. The use of very recent bibliography (2023-2025) is a strong point, ensuring relevance to the upcoming FP10 discussions.

However, the paper requires **Major Revisions** because it operates in an institutional vacuum. It argues for a new organizational form without adequately addressing existing EU territorial mechanisms (specifically Smart Specialisation Strategies - RIS3) or the potential risks of implementation. Furthermore, the prompt indicated an intention to "evaluate cases," yet the text remains entirely theoretical with no concrete examples of existing ARO-like entities acting in this capacity.

## 2. Strengths
*   **Conceptual Synthesis:** The application of Stokes’ "Pasteur’s Quadrant" to territorial governance is a novel and effective theoretical move. It successfully distinguishes the proposed ARO from standard university research or commercial consultancy.
*   **Bibliographic Currency:** The literature review is exceptionally up-to-date, incorporating key texts from 2024 and 2025 (e.g., *Pike et al., Sarkki et al., Borrell-Damian*) that accurately reflect the current state of the art in EU geography and innovation policy.
*   **Clarity of Thesis:** The argument that demographic urbanization is complete while governance remains static is articulated clearly and serves as a strong foundation for the problem statement.

## 3. Critical Issues (Must be Fixed)
*   **The "Smart Specialisation" Void:** It is a major oversight to discuss EU territorial innovation policy without mentioning **Smart Specialisation Strategies (RIS3)**. The EU has invested a decade in RIS3 to bridge the innovation gap in lagging regions. The paper must explain how an ARO differs from, complements, or replaces existing RIS3 structures. Without this, the proposal seems disconnected from actual EU policy history.
*   **Absence of Case Evaluation:** The research plan explicitly stated an intention to "evaluate cases that signal the emergent state of the art." The document cites taxonomies of AROs (Cruz-Castro) but provides no concrete examples. Are there existing prototypes? (e.g., Fraunhofer institutes in structural change regions, or specific Living Labs?). The theoretical argument needs empirical grounding.
*   **Lack of Counter-Arguments/Limitations:** The paper presents AROs as a "silver bullet." It fails to acknowledge potential failure modes, such as:
    *   **The "Cathedral in the Desert" syndrome:** High-tech research centers in lagging regions often fail to connect with the local economy.
    *   **Financial Sustainability:** AROs usually require significant public base funding. In "fragile" territories with low fiscal capacity, who pays?
*   **Vague "Institutionalization":** The main research question asks *how* AROs can be institutionalized. The paper answers *why* they should be. The "how" (funding instruments, legal frameworks, governance composition) is largely missing.

## 4. Suggestions
*   **Differentiate from RDAs:** Explicitly distinguish the proposed AROs from Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). RDAs implement policy; AROs (in your definition) should *experiment* and *generate knowledge*. Clarify this boundary.
*   **Operationalize "Regioning":** In the section on "Regioning Mission-Oriented Policy," provide a concrete example of what a "place-based experiment" looks like. For example, how would an ARO tackle a specific "polytrap" (e.g., energy poverty in a rural area) differently than a standard grant project?
*   **Refine the Definition of Fragility:** While the governance gap is crucial, ensure you acknowledge that "fragility" also implies a lack of *absorptive capacity*. AROs produce innovation, but fragile territories often lack the actors to *adopt* it. Address how the ARO bridges this specific gap (perhaps referencing *Papamichail et al.* more deeply regarding the capacity issues).

## 5. Missing Content
*   **Smart Specialisation (RIS3) Literature:** Essential for EU context.
*   **Triple/Quadruple Helix Model:** When discussing intermediaries, the interaction between government, academia, industry, and civil society is standard practice.
*   **Cohesion Policy Funding Streams:** Mention specific instruments (ERDF, ESF+, or Horizon Europe Widening actions) where this ARO would sit financially.

## 6. Specific Line Edits

*   **Abstract, Line 6:** "Drawing on the concept of 'Pasteur's Quadrant'..." -> *Suggestion:* Explicitly mention Donald Stokes (the originator) or clarify that you are using Pettigrew’s interpretation, as "Pasteur's Quadrant" is a seminal concept not unique to the cited papers.
*   **Section 1 (Introduction), Paragraph 2:** "AROs offer a model distinct from the pure basic research of universities..." -> *Critique:* This creates a binary that ignores technical universities or universities with strong "Third Mission" mandates. Soften to acknowledge that universities *can* do this, but often lack the incentive structures.
*   **Section 2.1, "Beyond the Lagging Region Label":** You cite *Jones et al. (2020)* regarding the deficit model. Ensure you explicitly connect this to the ARO solution: AROs should focus on *assets* rather than just fixing *deficits*.
*   **Section 3.2, "The Intermediary Role":** "AROs would act as a 'super intermediary'..." -> *Critique:* This is buzzword-heavy. Be specific. Does this mean they convene stakeholders? Do they co-fund prototypes?
*   **Section 4.2, "FP10 and the Place-Based Mandate":** "There is a clear 'conclusion' emerging..." -> *Edit:* Avoid framing policy debates as "conclusions" unless an official EU communication is cited. Better to say "There is a growing consensus..."

***

**Final Note to Author:** The theoretical core of this paper is strong, and the bibliography is excellent. However, to be accepted as a rigorous academic policy argument, it must stop treating the "institutional solution" in the abstract. You must contend with the crowded landscape of existing EU agencies and policies (RIS3) to prove that an ARO is truly the missing piece of the puzzle.
