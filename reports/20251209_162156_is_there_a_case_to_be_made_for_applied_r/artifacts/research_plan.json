    "How is territorial fragility defined within the current EU cohesion policy, specifically regarding the gap between completed demographic urbanization and lagging territorial governance?",
    "In what ways does the ARO model (high utility/high knowledge contribution) offer distinct advantages over traditional academic or consultancy models for solving 'left-behind' territorial problems?",
    "To what extent does the emerging EU Research & Innovation agenda (FP10 context) provide regulatory and funding pathways for mission-oriented, experimental research organisations?",
    "What constitutes the current 'emergent state of the art' in experimental territorial interventions, and how can these isolated cases inform the structural design of a permanent ARO?"
