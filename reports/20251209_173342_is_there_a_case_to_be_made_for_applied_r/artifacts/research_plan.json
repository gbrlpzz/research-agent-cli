  "sub_questions": [
    "How is 'territorial fragility' defined in current EU policy discourse, particularly regarding the innovation divide and 'left-behind' regions?",
    "What specific mechanisms do AROs and Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) utilize to translate innovation into regional economic resilience compared to basic research universities?",
    "How does the tension between 'excellence-based' funding and 'cohesion' objectives impact the distribution of applied research capabilities in the EU?",
    "What distinct programming instruments should be integrated into the 2028-2034 financial framework to empower AROs in addressing demographic and industrial decline in fragile territories?",
    "How can AROs align with the evolution from Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3) to Partnerships for Regional Innovation (PRI) in the next programming period?"
