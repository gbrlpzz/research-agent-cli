  "summary": "The research plan presents a compelling, well-structured argument for centralizing AROs/RTOs in FP10 to address territorial fragility. The conceptual framework effectively integrates 'left-behind places' (Pike et al.) and the 'regional innovation paradox' (Muscio et al.). Most citations are accurate and exist in the literature. However, one key citation regarding Territorial Impact Assessments (Prezioso 2025) could not be verified and may be hallucinated or incorrect, requiring immediate attention.",
  "strengths": [
    "Strong theoretical grounding: effectively connects the 'regional innovation paradox' (Muscio 2015) with the 'left-behind places' discourse (Pike 2024).",
    "Clear differentiation of RTOs: The distinction between RTOs as 'entrepreneurship instruments' (Khelfaoui & Bernier 2023) and traditional universities is well-supported.",
    "Policy Relevance: The argument for 'capacity building' funding streams in FP10 aligns with current debates on the future of Horizon Europe (Borrell-Damian 2025)."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Unverified Citation: The citation for Prezioso (2025) regarding 'Innovation in the territorial impact assessment' could not be found in major databases. This may be a hallucination or an error in the title/year.",
    "Lack of Specificity on FP10 Mechanisms: While the Borrell-Damian (2025) paper discusses Horizon Europe's future generally, the specific claim about integrating 'industrial policy' needs to be carefully attributed if not explicitly in that source."

  "hallucinations": [
    "@Innovation_in_t_Prezio_2025: Unable to verify existence of a paper titled 'Innovation in the territorial impact assessment: an application to large infrastructure projects' by Prezioso in 2025."

  "missing_content": [
    "Concrete examples of 'learning-intensive' services provided by RTOs in lagging regions (beyond the INO case).",
    "Discussion on how state aid rules might affect the centralized funding of AROs in these regions."
