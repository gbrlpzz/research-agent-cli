  abstract: [
    As the European Union transitions towards the 2028-2034 research mandate (FP10), addressing the deepening governance gap in "left-behind places" has become a critical priority. This paper argues for the strategic institutionalization of Applied Research Organizations (AROs) operating in "Pasteur's Quadrant"---combining high utility with fundamental understanding---to tackle territorial fragility. By synthesizing recent literature on mission-oriented innovation policy (MOIP) and regional discontent, and comparing emergent prototypes such as Smart Villages and Innovation Brokers, we demonstrate that AROs offer a distinct advantage over traditional academic or commercial models in resolving the complex "polytraps" of rural and inner peripheries. We propose that AROs can serve as the operational engine for the EU's next generation of territorial cohesion strategies, bridging the divide between high-level policy missions and local implementation reality.

= Introduction: The Divergence of Governance
The completion of the demographic urbanization shift in Europe has left a fractured territorial landscape. While metropolitan hubs thrive as engines of the knowledge economy, vast "inner peripheries" and rural landscapes face a crisis of relevance and governance @Left_behind_pl_Pike_2024. These "left-behind places" are not merely economically disadvantaged; they are increasingly defined by "geographies of discontent" where traditional policy instruments have failed to arrest decline @Discontent_and_Bernar_2025 @Forgotten_Territories_Desjardins_2022.

As the European Union prepares its research and innovation framework for the 2028-2034 period (FP10), there is a pressing need to rethink the *institutional* architecture of regional development. Current discussions on the future of Horizon Europe emphasize the need for research that is not only excellent but socially impactful and mission-oriented, with calls to double the science budget to meet these "grand challenges" @A_view_of_Horiz_Borrel_2025 @Europe_Must_Double_Allen_2024. However, a structural gap remains: who translates these high-level missions into place-based solutions for fragile territories?

This paper argues that the answer lies in a revitalized model of the Applied Research Organization (ARO). Situated in "Pasteur's Quadrant"---seeking both fundamental understanding and immediate use @Pest_science_in_Mangel_2024---AROs are uniquely positioned to address the "wicked problems" of territorial fragility. Unlike traditional universities (often focused on disciplinary contribution) or commercial consultancies (focused on short-term utility), AROs can provide the sustained, experimental, and deeply contextualized research required to transform left-behind places @Universities_Applied_Yalcin_2022.

= The Institutional Void: Territorial Fragility and Governance
Territorial fragility in the EU is characterized by a "development trap" where regions face structural stagnation relative to national and European averages. Recent scholarship identifies these areas not just by low GDP, but by a complex interplay of demographic outflow, service depletion, and institutional decay @Sustainable_and_Benner_2024. This inequality increasingly extends beyond economics to include access to fundamental rights and essential services @Between_Policy_Jubany_2025.

== The Governance Gap
A critical failure in current policy is the disconnect between top-down investment and local absorptive capacity. "Left-behind places" often lack the institutional thickness to leverage EU innovation funds effectively. As noted by Benner et al. (2024), these regions require "neo-endogenous development" strategies that build on local assets rather than importing generic growth models @Sustainable_and_Benner_2024. However, the governance mechanisms to facilitate this—specifically, the ability to co-design and implement complex transitions—are frequently absent. This void is particularly acute in "inner peripheries," where proximity to urban centers does not translate into economic integration @Potential_Innovative_Adamowicz_2021.

== Polytraps in Rural Landscapes
The situation is further complicated by "polytraps"---interlocking ecological, social, and economic maladaptations. For instance, in European rural mountainous regions, efforts to modernize often conflict with traditional land uses, creating a gridlock that neither preserves heritage nor fosters innovation. Sarkki et al. (2025) argue that these traps are "self-reinforcing," requiring external disruption through experimental governance to unlock new development pathways @Polytraps_in_Eu_Sarkki_2025. Breaking these traps requires more than funding; it requires an experimental, iterative research approach that can test solutions in real-time.

= Defining the Actor: AROs in Pasteur's Quadrant
To address these challenges, we propose the "Applied Research Organization" (ARO) as a key governance instrument. The theoretical foundation for the ARO is "Pasteur's Quadrant," a concept reintroduced to contemporary science policy to describe research that is "inspired by use" while simultaneously seeking "fundamental understanding" @At_the_nexus_of_Pettig_2022.

== Beyond Bohr and Edison
Traditional research models often fall into two other categories:
- *Bohr's Quadrant:* Pure basic research (e.g., standard university departments), which may produce knowledge too abstract for immediate territorial application.
- *Edison's Quadrant:* Pure applied research (e.g., commercial R&D), which solves specific technical problems but rarely addresses the systemic root causes of fragility.

In contrast, AROs in Pasteur's Quadrant operate at the nexus. They are capable of understanding the fundamental sociology and ecology of a "left-behind" region (the *science* of fragility) while simultaneously developing and testing practical interventions (the *utility* of resilience) @Pest_science_in_Mangel_2024. This dual mandate is essential for territorial governance, where "simple" technical fixes frequently fail due to a lack of systemic understanding.

= Strategic Alignment: The EU 2028-2034 Agenda
The emerging consensus for the post-2027 EU research framework centers on "Mission-Oriented Innovation Policy" (MOIP). This approach shifts focus from sector-specific support to solving grand societal challenges @Revitalizing_de_Somogy_2025 @Challenge_Driven_Mazzucato_2019. The 2028-2034 mandate is expected to deepen this commitment, moving from "mission identification" to "mission operationalization."

== Operationalizing Missions in Fragile Regions
While MOIP provides the "directionality" for innovation, it struggles with implementation in lagging regions due to weak local ecosystems. AROs can serve as the "mission intermediaries." Cappellano and Kurowska-Pysz (2020) demonstrate that mission-oriented approaches in cross-border regions require dedicated organizations to facilitate "bottom-up participation" and align local stakeholders with broader EU goals @The_Mission_Ori_Cappel_2020. 

By embedding AROs within fragile territories, the EU can create permanent institutional anchors that:
1.  **Translate Missions:** Convert abstract EU climate or digital targets into locally relevant projects @Transport_Policy_Gavanas_2024.
2.  **Build Capacity:** Retain high-skilled human capital in peripheral areas, countering the "brain drain" typical of development traps @Potential_Innovative_Adamowicz_2021.
3.  **Ensure Continuity:** Provide long-term monitoring and adaptation of development strategies, unlike project-based consultancies that leave once funding expires.

= State of the Art: Comparative Analysis of Emergent AROs
While the ARO model is not fully institutionalized across all EU member states, distinct prototypes have emerged that demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in fragile contexts. These "proto-AROs" operate as experimental governance labs, providing empirical validation for the Pasteur’s Quadrant model in rural development.

== Innovation Brokers in High Nature Value Areas
A compelling example of the ARO function is found in the role of "Innovation Brokers" within High Nature Value (HNV) farming landscapes. Bernard et al. (2023) identify these actors not merely as agricultural advisors, but as systemic intermediaries who bridge the gap between conservation science (fundamental understanding) and farming viability (utility) @Innovation_Brok_Bernard_2023. These organizations often sit outside traditional government structures, allowing them to facilitate "social innovation" in regions paralyzed by conflicting land-use demands.

== Smart Villages and Living Labs
The "Smart Villages" initiative represents a significant move towards "experimental governance" where the territory itself becomes a laboratory. Cāne (2021) highlights that Smart Villages act as catalysts for "rural digital transformation," enabling communities to overcome the "digital divide" through iterative testing of new service models @Smart_Villages_Cane_2021 @Smart_Villages_Stojanova_2021.

Recent evidence from Moldova's "Smart City" initiatives in rural hubs demonstrates that these interventions can successfully balance innovation with local tradition, provided there is a "governance bridge" to manage the transition @Smart_Cities_Moldova_Rosca_2025. Similarly, "Rural Living Labs" in Catalonia have successfully tested circular economy models by integrating local SMEs with regional research centers @Fostering_Rural_Interreg_2024. These initiatives differ from traditional AROs in their temporary nature (often project-funded), but they prove the concept: when high-quality research capacity is embedded locally, peripheral regions can innovate.

== The Startup Village Initiative
At the policy level, the European Commission’s "Startup Village" concept aims to foster "entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystems" in rural areas @Startup_Village_JRC_2024. While currently focused on entrepreneurship, this initiative highlights the need for *institutional anchors*. AROs could serve as the "backbone" organizations for these villages, providing the R&D infrastructure that startups in peripheral locations typically lack.

= Conclusion
The governance of territorial fragility requires more than new policies; it requires new institutions. The "left-behind" places of Europe cannot be revitalized solely by market forces or distant bureaucratic decrees. They require the situated intelligence of Applied Research Organizations operating in Pasteur's Quadrant.

As the EU shapes its 2028-2034 research mandate, there is a compelling case to move beyond project-based funding and invest in the *institutional infrastructure* of AROs. By learning from emergent examples like Innovation Brokers and Smart Village labs, the Union can ensure that its innovation agenda does not merely accelerate the success of the center, but provides the structural support necessary to heal its fragile peripheries.
