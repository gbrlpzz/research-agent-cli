@article{Discontent_and_Bernar_2025,
  abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Debates on left‐behind places, rural resentment and spatial disadvantage posit that political discontent stems from perceived inequalities between regions and on the urban/rural interface. The popularity of this argument is fuelled by frequent mapping of electoral results, which very often demonstrates a spatial correspondence between increased Euroscepticism and Populism on the one hand, and rural peripherality, shrinkage, economic and health issues and other forms of social disadvantage on the other. This paper advances the debate by distinguishing between regional attitudinal effects and social mobility effects, proposing an explicitly multidimensional conceptualisation of regional left‐behindness and indicating that regional effects do not act uniformly across different countries. Using European Values Study data, the paper examines how intergenerational educational mobility and distrust of the EU are affected by regional left‐behindness across Europe, finding weak and non‐uniform effects. Whereas EU distrust is more strongly associated with regional growth, low educational mobility is more affected by the poor regional prosperity typical of rural areas. However, the effects vary considerably across individual countries.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>There has been a sea change in the scientific world, advanced even more rapidly by the recent compounded public crises. Accelerated discovery, and impact from such discoveries have come from convergence approaches across disciplines, sectors, institutions, and the multiple communities seeking the common goal of innovations that transform. The classic simultaneous pursuit of fundamental understanding and application has been termed  Pasteur\textquotesingle s quadrant, where use-inspired basic research occurs. In the classic schematic developed by Donald Stokes, three quadrants  represent research approaches using a 2D plane in which the vertical dimension represents the quest for understanding (basic research) and the horizontal dimension represents the consideration of use (applied research). The three outer quadrants are Bohr\textquotesingle s (pure basic research), Edison\textquotesingle s (pure applied research), and Pasteur\textquotesingle s (use-inspired  basic research). Viewing each of these axes as a continuum, we label the previously unnamed but contributory cell as the Innominate quadrant, where a nonzero amount of discovery and applied research also has value in generating scientific tools, novel processes or products that inform the other quadrants. More importantly, a reimagined Pasteur\textquotesingle s quadrant schema shows a third dimension of Transformations over Time, occurring through a continuous fluid interchange among the quadrants.  Transformative innovations may originate from any single quadrant.  While work in Pasteur\textquotesingle s quadrant has been shown to be highly productive, a dynamic fluid interchange among the quadrants is often involved and generates transformative advances at a faster rate. This should inform how we fund science, engineering, and medicine and educate the next generation of innovators.</jats:p>},

@article{Sustainable_and_Benner_2024,
  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Scholarly work in economic geography and regional science has recently seen a renewed interest in spatial inequalities, driven significantly by the debate on left-behind places and the resulting geographies of discontent. The plight of left-behind places calls for new place-based policy responses that address the specific challenges of these regions but that at the same time address grand societal challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, or pollution with synthetic chemicals. Despite growing attention among economic geographers and regional scientists to either green or inclusive regional development approaches, how to reconcile environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness in highly challenged left-behind places remains poorly understood. This editorial reflects on and critically discusses the literature on left-behind places and distils unifying conceptual characteristics of left-behindness. We argue that left-behindness is a temporal, relational, multidimensional, discursive, but not deterministic concept. The non-determinism of left-behindness opens up different choices for actors to shape regional futures. Imagining and negotiating these futures involves dealing with difficult potential trade-offs between environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness, some of which are explored by the articles in this special issue.</jats:p>},

@article{The_Mission_Ori_Cappel_2020,
  abstract = {<jats:p>During the times of the COVID-19 pandemic, nations have issued unprecedented border closures around the world, yielding abrupt impacts on the movement of goods and people. This has heavily affected the quality of life in border regions, which are often found to be at a disadvantage when compared to other regions in terms of employment, accessibility, social services and economic growth. Based upon developing threads in the literature concerning the untapped potential for development in border regions, we argue that the Mission-Oriented Approach (MOA) can fit well with the ambitious goal to revitalize those territories in the aftermath of the pandemic. Despite the surge of MOA in discourses on innovation policy, we seek to implement it in a regional development perspective, pursuing both economic and social policy objectives. The authors unravel the policy concept of MOA into three main aspects: (I) address a sound societal challenge; (II) Research \&amp; Development (R\&amp;D) regional agenda embedded in a cross-border regional development vision; (III) mobilizing multiple cross-sectorial projects. Through a desk study analysis, the authors draw insights from selected case studies where these aspects have been implemented to inspire policy intervention in the aftermath of COVID-19. This paper presents the MOA theoretical model, which has potential explanatory power in other cross-border regions.</jats:p>},

@article{Pest_science_in_Mangel_2024,
  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>More than 25 years ago, Donald Stokes argued that we must move beyond the false dichotomy of basic or applied research and suggested that when considering a program of scientific research it is important to ask whether (i) the work is motivated by use and (ii) if there is a search for fundamental understanding. Giving yes/no answers to these questions allows us to characterize research more fully, replacing the \textquotedblleft or\textquotedblright  of \textquotedblleft basic or applied\textquotedblright  by a richer understanding of the process of science. Stokes proposed that research that was motivated by a consideration of use and sought fundamental understanding be called research in Pasteur’s Quadrant. One advantage of such work is that the search for fundamental understanding means that the problem-solving tools are more likely to be transferrable. After reviewing Stokes’s formulation of research, I illustrate it with examples from the control of tephritid flies and the use of insect parasitoids for biological control. Thinking about one’s work within Stokes’s framework has many advantages for individual scientists, including guidance for journal selection, how to organize and conclude papers and seminars, and the \textquotedblleft elevator speech.\textquotedblright  Furthermore, since research in Pasteur’s Quadrant has the characteristic of simultaneously increasing our understanding of how the world works and improving applications, it will more likely benefit the community of pest scientists.</jats:p>},
