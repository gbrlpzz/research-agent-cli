  abstract = {<jats:p>Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) have key roles in stories of national industrial development in many countries, and in various contexts they have transformed according to changes in their surrounding economic and policy environments. This paper proposes a conceptual framework of ‘RTOs as super intermediaries’ as they play multiple intermediary roles in the triple helix (government, research and industry), the overlap of industrial policy and research policy, and research-industry frontiers. The framework helps in understanding and advancing the role of RTOs in industrial development, particularly in developing countries. For a case study, the paper showcases research in Tanzania that explored possibilities of revamping RTOs and whether investing in them would help in spurring Tanzania\textquotesingle s industrial development. Through key informant interviews and systemic literature review, a case study on the challenges and opportunities of RTOs was designed to examine their role and potential in industrial development and technology innovation processes. The study findings were overall in-line with two main lenses of inquiry: 1) that for RTOs to play their key roles in Tanzania, industrial policies shaped by the command economy era before the 1990s need to be reviewed and modified; and 2) that more investment in revamping RTOs will take place if policymaking processes acknowledge RTOs as super intermediaries. To organize policy lessons drawn, a multi-level policy map\textemdash micro, meso and macro\textemdash was utilized as an analytical tool.</jats:p>},

@article{Cohesion_or_Wid_Pato_2023,
  abstract = {<jats:p>This comprehensive analysis investigates the effectiveness of EU funding in promoting research and innovation across various regions, with a specific focus on the Horizon Europe Programme. In this study, we employed a mixed-quantitative analysis of funding allocation data sourced from the Horizon Europe Dashboard and the Global Innovation Index. We systematically analysed the distribution of Horizon Europe funds from 2021 to 2023 across all EU Member States and their respective NUTS 2 regions, focusing on per capita and per researcher fund allocation. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted to assess the alignment between fund distribution and innovation indicators such as R\&amp;D intensity and innovation outputs.The study also critically examines the EU’s cohesion policy, which is fundamentally designed to reduce regional disparities and promote equal opportunities across all EU regions. Through our analysis, we aim to assess whether the current implementation of the EU’s financial instruments aligns with the overarching goals of cohesion policy, particularly in terms of fostering uniform economic growth and development. This examination is crucial as it highlights the need for the values of cohesion to be more effectively integrated into the criteria systems of directly managed EU funding programs to achieve its intended objectives of regional and territorial cohesion.The study reveals persistent and widening disparities in the distribution of funds, which accentuate regional and national inequalities within the EU. Despite significant financial allocations aimed at fostering innovation, the evidence points to a concentrated benefit in specific regions, particularly those already developed, thereby raising concerns about the equitable promotion of technological advancement and economic growth across less developed areas. The findings underscore the need for a more balanced and strategic approach to funding that ensures all regions can contribute to and benefit from Europe’s innovation landscape. This research contributes crucial insights into the complexities of funding allocation, the challenges of regional disparities, and the potential pathways towards a more inclusive innovation policy within the European Union.</jats:p>},

While participation in European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme <ns3:bold>and Horizon 2020</ns3:bold> is associated with stronger research capacities in already well-developed regions, no significant relationship is found between EU-funded R\&amp;D and increases in publications or patents at an aggregate level. However, a positive correlation emerges between EU R\&amp;D funding and <ns3:bold>GDP growth in less developed regions</ns3:bold>, suggesting that while direct scientific outputs may not always materialize, economic benefits arise through alternative channels such as <ns3:bold>small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) engagement</ns3:bold>, infrastructure improvements, and knowledge diffusion. Conclusions The study highlights the broader implications of transnational funding frameworks for regional economic convergence within the <ns3:bold>EU</ns3:bold>. Despite limited effects on immediate research outputs in less developed regions, competitive EU R\&amp;D programs contribute to economic resilience in lagging regions, raising important considerations for multi-level governance and international cooperation. These results align with debates in International Relations regarding the role of supra-national institutions in shaping equitable economic outcomes and addressing structural imbalances across Member States. As EU funding strategies evolve, a more integrated approach that strengthens innovation ecosystems in underperforming regions could enhance European research policy\textquotesingle s inclusivity and long-term impact.</ns3:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An emerging field of research suggests that the policy and societal pressures for a green transition represent a \textquotedblleft green window of opportunity\textquotedblright  for peripheral regions. These regions often lag behind in overall innovation performance and may suffer from being places that don’t matter. At the same time, these are exactly the regions that the European Union is trying to support through several programmes, including Horizon Europe. This paper investigates the participation of organisations from peripheral regions in environmental projects funded by the Horizon Europe programme. To account for the multidimensional nature of regional peripherality, we define peripheral regions from a geographical, innovation and socio-economic perspective. We then analyse the relationship between these dimensions of regional peripherality and the extent to which regions benefit from Horizon environmental innovation projects in terms of participation, amount of funding and position in the overall network of project consortia.</jats:p><jats:p>Our findings show a greater participation in Horizon environmental innovation projects for regions in Southern and Northern Europe, while within-country peripherality is negatively related to participation. At the same time, regions that are lagging in terms of innovation and socio-economic performance also receive less of this specific funding. Overall, geographical peripherality only tells a part of the story as several \textquotedblleft places that don’t matter\textquotedblright  for innovation and economic dynamism are also unable to benefit from these specific green windows of opportunity.</jats:p>},

               <jats:p>Economic change over the past 20 years has rendered many individuals and territories vulnerable, leading to greater interpersonal and interterritorial inequality. This rising inequality is seen as a root cause of populism. Yet, there is no comparative evidence as to whether this discontent is the consequence of localised interpersonal inequality or stagnant growth in ‘left-behind’ places. This article assesses the association between levels and changes in local GDP per capita and interpersonal inequality, and the rise of far-right populism in Europe and in the USA. The analysis\textemdash conducted at small region level for Europe and county level for the USA\textemdash shows that there are both similarities and differences in the factors connected to populist voting on both sides of the Atlantic. In the USA, neither interpersonal inequality nor economic decline can explain populist support on their own. However, these factors gain significance when considered together with the racial composition of the area. Counties with a large share of white population where economic growth has been stagnant and where inequalities have increased supported Donald Trump. Meanwhile, counties with a similar economic trajectory but with a higher share of minorities shunned populism. In Europe, the most significant factor behind the rise of far-right populism is economic decline. This effect is particularly large in areas with a high share of immigration.</jats:p>},
