  "full_text": "**VERDICT**: Major Revisions\n\n**SUMMARY**: \nThis manuscript has improved since the first round, particularly in removing the irrelevant Tanzanian case study and qualifying the biomedical references. The central argument\u2014that FP10 must move beyond \"excellence\" to build institutional capacity in fragile regions\u2014remains compelling and well-aligned with the \"geography of discontent\" literature. However, the author failed to address a critical instruction regarding the **Heitor Group** citation, which remains absent from the bibliography. Furthermore, new verification checks reveal that the citation of @New_tech_spaces_Ciapet_2018 directly misrepresents the source's findings, and the attribution of the \"cathedrals in the desert\" metaphor remains problematic. These issues indicate a persistent lack of bibliographic rigor that must be corrected before publication.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n- The removal of the geographically irrelevant @Research_and_Te_Sheikh_2021 citation improves the validity of the RTO definition section.\n- The qualification of the @Shaping_the_fut_Ellmei_2025 reference (specifying it is a proposal from the *health* sector) effectively addresses the previous scope error.\n- The use of Pato et al. (@Cohesion_or_Wid_Pato_2023) provides strong, verified empirical support for the \"excellence trap\" argument regarding funding concentration.\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n- **Missing Bibliography Entry (Recurrent)**: The previous review explicitly requested the inclusion of the \"Heitor Group\" report in the bibliography. While the text now mentions \"(Heitor et al., 2024)\", there is **no corresponding entry in `refs.bib`** nor a proper `@citation_key`. As this report is central to the \"Strategic Implications\" section, this omission is a critical failure of the revision.\n- **Citation Misrepresentation**: The manuscript claims that @New_tech_spaces_Ciapet_2018 \"find that RTO networks are heavily concentrated in the 'old tech places' of the industrial core.\" This contradicts the source's actual findings. Ciapetti and Perulli explicitly state they found *no significant spatial autocorrelation* to support the idea that RTOs are broadly concentrated in old industrial regions; they argue that technological diversity is a better predictor than the \"old tech\" base.\n- **Attribution & \"Quote\" Precision**: The phrase \"cathedrals in the desert\" is now attributed to @Cohesion_Policy_Cresce_2020. While Crescenzi et al. discuss the effectiveness of policies in Southern Italy, they do not appear to use this specific metaphorical phrase in the cited text. If the authors do not use the exact phrase, remove the quotation marks or cite the original source of the metaphor (e.g., development literature on the Mezzogiorno).\n\n**RECOMMENDED PAPERS**:\nRECOMMEND SEARCH: \"Align, Act, Accelerate Heitor report\" | Reason: Mandatory inclusion for the Heitor Group citation.\nRECOMMEND SEARCH: \"cathedrals in the desert industrial policy\" | Reason: To find the original source of this metaphor if Crescenzi does not use it.\n\n**SPECIFIC EDITS**:\n\nSection: Strategic Implications for FP10\nIssue: Missing bibliography entry for a key authority.\nSuggestion: You cite \"Heitor et al., 2024\" in the text but failed to add it to `refs.bib`. Add the report (likely *Align, Act, Accelerate: Research, Technology and Innovation to boost European Competitiveness*) to your bibliography and use a proper `@key`.\n\nSection: The Empirical Gap in Lagging Regions\nIssue: Misrepresentation of @New_tech_spaces_Ciapet_2018.\nSuggestion: The cited paper finds that RTOs are *not* strictly concentrated in \"old tech places\" but follow a more complex pattern of technological diversity. Rewrite the sentence to reflect that RTO networks are fragmented or that access is uneven, without falsely attributing a \"concentration in old tech places\" finding to this paper.\n\nSection: Counter-Arguments and Limitations\nIssue: Attribution of \"Cathedrals in the desert\".\nSuggestion: Verify if @Cohesion_Policy_Cresce_2020 actually uses the phrase \"cathedrals in the desert\". If not, remove the quotation marks to treat it as a concept rather than a direct quote, or cite the original author of the metaphor.\n\nSection: The Role of RTOs: Theory vs. Reality\nIssue: Unverifiable quantitative claim.\nSuggestion: The claim \"for every Euro invested, multiple Euros of economic activity were generated\" citing @Economic_Footpr_Taverd_2022 is vague. Provide the specific multiplier (e.g., \"generated \u20ac4.50 for every \u20ac1\") if available in the text, or soften the claim to \"generated a positive economic multiplier.\""
