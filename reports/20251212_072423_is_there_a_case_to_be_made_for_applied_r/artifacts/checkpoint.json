This paper investigates the potential of Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) to address territorial fragility within the architecture of the upcoming Tenth Framework Programme (FP10). While RTOs theoretically function as critical intermediaries for place-based innovation, empirical evidence reveals a significant gap: current excellence-based funding mechanisms in Horizon Europe (FP9) have exacerbated regional disparities, concentrating resources in established hubs while under-incentivizing engagement in peripheral regions. Drawing on recent data regarding the \"innovation divide\" and the operational limitations of \"Widening\" instruments, we argue that FP10 must institutionalize specific mandates for RTOs to build local absorptive capacity. We conclude that without a structural shift from purely excellence-driven competition to mission-oriented territorial resilience, the \"geography of discontent\" will continue to widen.\n  ]\n)\n\n#outline(indent: auto)\n#pagebreak()\n\n= Introduction\nThe spatial distribution of innovation capacity in Europe remains stubbornly uneven. Despite decades of Cohesion Policy, a significant \"innovation divide\" persists between the core manufacturing belts of Northern/Western Europe and the peripheral regions of the South and East @Bridging_Europe_Chumac_2025. As the European Union prepares for the Tenth Framework Programme (FP10), the question of how to integrate these \"territorially fragile\" areas into the European Research Area (ERA) has gained renewed urgency.\n\nThis paper examines the role of Applied Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs)\u2014such as Fraunhofer, TNO, or Tecnalia\u2014in addressing this fragility. While universities drive fundamental research, RTOs are uniquely positioned to translate knowledge into industrial application, making them theoretically ideal vectors for regional economic restructuring @Economic_Footpr_Taverd_2022. However, evidence suggests that the current funding architecture under Horizon Europe (FP9) has failed to leverage this potential in the regions that need it most @Cohesion_or_Wid_Pato_2023.\n\nWe argue that for FP10 to succeed where its predecessors have struggled, it must move beyond passive \"Widening\" measures and actively incentivize RTOs to establish operational footprints in fragile territories, linking funding not just to scientific excellence but to the generation of local \"institutional thickness\" and resilience.\n\n= Defining Territorial Fragility\nTerritorial fragility in the EU context is no longer defined solely by GDP per capita. Recent scholarship has reframed the problem around the concept of \"left-behind places\"\u2014regions that have experienced long-term trajectories of relative decline, loss of local services, and a thinning of the institutional fabric required for economic adaptation @Left_behind_ver_Rodrig_2023.\n\n== The Trap of Institutional Thinness\nUnlike merely \"poor\" regions, fragile territories often suffer from a \"development trap\" characterized by low innovation capacity and weak governance @The_Geography_o_Rodrig_2024. This fragility is driven by a lack of \"absorptive capacity\"\u2014the ability of local firms to identify, assimilate, and exploit external knowledge @Administrative_Bachtr_2024.\nRodriguez-Pose @The_revenge_of_Rodrig_2018 argues that the neglect of these regions has fueled a \"geography of discontent,\" where economic stagnation translates into political instability. The definition of fragility thus encompasses:\n- *Economic dimension*: Persistent productivity gaps and reliance on declining industries.\n- *Institutional dimension*: A lack of intermediary organizations (like RTOs) that can bridge the gap between basic research and firm-level adoption @Rescaling_urban_Mendez_2021.\n- *Social dimension*: Brain drain and demographic decline which further erodes the skills base.\n\n= The Role of RTOs: Theory vs. Reality\nResearch and Technology Organisations are distinct from universities in their mission to support industry through applied research and development. In theory, they act as \"super-intermediaries\" capable of orchestrating regional innovation ecosystems.\n\n== The Theoretical Potential\nLiterature on innovation systems highlights the role of RTOs in providing \"club goods\" for innovation\u2014shared infrastructure, testing facilities, and specialized expertise that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) cannot afford individually @Work_and_Effect_Schenk_2017. RTOs mobilize the regional environment by bridging the gap between knowledge generation and commercial application @Research_and_te_Rincon_2017. They are critical in leading R&D collaborations that smaller firms could not manage alone @Research_techno_Albors_2014. \n\nA study of a large French RTO demonstrated its significant economic footprint, showing that for every Euro invested, multiple Euros of economic activity were generated in the surrounding ecosystem @Economic_Footpr_Taverd_2022. In the context of Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3), RTOs are envisioned as the \"entrepreneurial discovery\" agents that identify new domains of competitive advantage @Smart_specialis_Barzot_2020.\n\n== The Empirical Gap in Lagging Regions\nHowever, the reality of RTO engagement in fragile regions is starkly different. Empirical studies indicate a \"regional innovation paradox\": the regions with the greatest need for innovation support have the lowest capacity to access it @The_Regional_In_Oughto_2002.\nWhile some assume RTOs are simply concentrated in old industrial hubs, Ciapetti and Perulli @New_tech_spaces_Ciapet_2018 offer a more nuanced view: they find *no significant spatial autocorrelation* of RTO networks generally. Instead, they argue that RTO presence is driven more by \"technological diversity\" than simple geography. This implies that fragile regions are not excluded merely because of their location, but because they lack the specific technological complexity required to anchor these organizations.\nConsequently, there is \"insufficient direct evidence\" of RTOs successfully driving structural change in peripheral regions without massive, sustained public subsidy @Addressing_Publ_Papami_2023. This suggests that RTOs do not naturally \"trickle down\" to fragile areas; the market for applied research remains fragmented and exclusionary for regions without pre-existing technological density.\n\n= The Failure of Horizon Europe (FP9) Instruments\nThe current Framework Programme, Horizon Europe, attempts to address these disparities through its \"Widening Participation\" pillar. However, evidence suggests these measures are structurally insufficient.\n\n== The Excellence Trap\nFP9 operates primarily on the principle of \"excellence,\" defined by bibliometric indicators and past grant success. This creates a cumulative advantage (Matthieu effect) for established hubs. Pato et al. @Cohesion_or_Wid_Pato_2023 provide damning statistics: between 2021 and 2023, the \"Widening\" countries (EU13) received only ~8% of total funding despite representing 23% of the population.\nFurthermore, the success rate of consortia led by peripheral institutions remains significantly lower than those led by core institutions. The \"Widening\" instruments (Teaming, Twinning) are often criticized for being too small in scale to alter the structural incentives of major RTOs @Horizon_Europe_Penalo_2024. They fund \"soft\" networking rather than the \"hard\" institutional presence required to build local capacity.\n\n= Strategic Implications for FP10\nAs the architecture of FP10 is debated, there is a growing consensus that \"business as usual\" will not close the innovation divide. Recent expert group reports, such as the *Align, Act, Accelerate* report (Heitor et al., 2024), have signaled a need for more radical simplification and impact-orientation, pushing for a future framework that better integrates competitiveness with cohesion objectives @Heitor_Align_2024.\n\n== Integrating Place-Based Indicators\nFor FP10 to address territorial fragility, it must integrate \"place-based\" metrics into its core evaluation criteria\u2014not just for Widening actions, but for mainstream calls.\n- *Mandated Regional Partnerships*: Innovative models from other sectors could be adapted; for instance, the Biomedical Alliance has proposed \"twinning\" mechanisms to link research leaders with less developed institutions to build capacity in health research @Shaping_the_fut_Ellmei_2025. A similar mandate for RTOs in FP10 could condition funding for large-scale projects on established operational partnerships in fragile regions.\n- *Capacity Building Missions*: New instruments should fund the *process* of institution building, acknowledging that fragile regions need time to develop the administrative capacity to manage complex R&D projects @Administrative_Bachtr_2024.\n\n== Leveraging Smart Specialisation (S3)\nFP10 should more tightly couple R&D funding with the S3 priorities of regions. While earlier subsidy programs often failed to boost general firm performance, Crescenzi et al. @Cohesion_Policy_Cresce_2020 found that they did have a positive impact specifically in *low-tech* sectors. Since many fragile regions rely on low-to-medium tech industries, RTOs in FP10 should be incentivized to target these specific sectors rather than solely pursuing high-tech \"excellence\" which may not match local absorptive capacity.\n\n= Counter-Arguments and Limitations\nIt is necessary to acknowledge the risks associated with forcing RTOs into fragile regions.\n* *The \"Cathedral in the Desert\" Risk*: Simply planting an RTO outpost in a region with no industrial absorptive capacity risks replicating the classic \"cathedrals in the desert\" syndrome (cattedrali nel deserto)\u2014large infrastructure with no local supply chain connections. This phenomenon, observed in previous top-down industrial policies in Southern Italy, warns that without a local fabric of firms to uptake innovation, infrastructure becomes a white elephant @Cohesion_Policy_Cresce_2020. Developing \"institutional thickness\" takes decades, not a single funding cycle @Left_behind_pl_Pike_2024.\n* *Dilution of Excellence*: Critics argue that introducing cohesion objectives into the Framework Programme dilutes its primary mission of global competitiveness. If European RTOs are forced to subsidize peripheral development, they may lose ground to US or Asian competitors @A_view_of_Horiz_Borrel_2025.\n* *Political Friction*: There is often resistance from Member States to mixing the \"excellence\" pot (Framework Programmes) with the \"redistribution\" pot (Structural Funds).\n\n= Conclusion\nThe case for Applied Research Organisations to address territorial fragility in FP10 is strong, but it requires a departure from the \"neutral\" geography of previous programmes. The evidence shows that without specific territorial incentives, the \"market\" for research and innovation will continue to bypass the EU's most vulnerable regions @The_Geography_o_Rodrig_2024.\nFP10 represents a window of opportunity to redefine \"excellence\" to include the capacity to uplift regional ecosystems. By incentivizing RTOs to act as anchors in left-behind places\u2014focusing on realistic, low-tech interventions where appropriate\u2014the EU can move from a policy of compensatory transfers to one of structural resilience.\n\n#bibliography(\"refs.bib\")",
