[End of New Literature]

--- REVIEWER 1 (major_revisions) ---
Summary: This manuscript has improved since the first round, particularly in removing the irrelevant Tanzanian case study and qualifying the biomedical references. The central argument—that FP10 must move beyond "excellence" to build institutional capacity in fragile regions—remains compelling and well-aligned with the "geography of discontent" literature. However, the author failed to address a critical instruction regarding the **Heitor Group** citation, which remains absent from the bibliography. Furthermore, new verification checks reveal that the citation of @New_tech_spaces_Ciapet_2018 directly misrepresents the source's findings, and the attribution of the "cathedrals in the desert" metaphor remains problematic. These issues indicate a persistent lack of bibliographic rigor that must be corrected before publication.
Weaknesses: - **Missing Bibliography Entry (Recurrent)**: The previous review explicitly requested the inclusion of the "Heitor Group" report in the bibliography. While the text now mentions "(Heitor et al., 2024)", there is **no corresponding entry in `refs.bib`** nor a proper `@citation_key`. As this report is central to the "Strategic Implications" section, this omission is a critical failure of the revision.
- **Citation Misrepresentation**: The manuscript claims that @New_tech_spaces_Ciapet_2018 "find that RTO networks are heavily concentrated in the 'old tech places' of the industrial core." This contradicts the source's actual findings. Ciapetti and Perulli explicitly state they found *no significant spatial autocorrelation* to support the idea that RTOs are broadly concentrated in old industrial regions; they argue that technological diversity is a better predictor than the "old tech" base.
- **Attribution & "Quote" Precision**: The phrase "cathedrals in the desert" is now attributed to @Cohesion_Policy_Cresce_2020. While Crescenzi et al. discuss the effectiveness of policies in Southern Italy, they do not appear to use this specific metaphorical phrase in the cited text. If the authors do not use the exact phrase, remove the quotation marks or cite the original source of the metaphor (e.g., development literature on the Mezzogiorno).
