  "full_text": "**VERDICT**: Major Revisions\n\n**SUMMARY**:\nThis manuscript presents a timely and logically structured argument for repositioning Applied Research Organisations (RTOs) within the EU's FP10 programming to address territorial fragility. The central thesis\u2014that \"excellence-based\" funding exacerbates regional divergence and that RTOs require specific place-based mandates\u2014is compelling and well-aligned with current debates on the \"innovation divide.\" However, the document suffers from **significant citation context errors** and **missing key references**. Several claims rest on literature that is either geographically irrelevant (Tanzania) or sector-specific (Health) but presented as general evidence. These methodological flaws undermine the rigor of the policy recommendations.\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n- **Strong Narrative Arc**: The progression from \"defining fragility\" to \"FP9 failures\" and \"FP10 solutions\" is coherent and persuasive.\n- **Evidence-Based Critique of FP9**: The use of Pato et al. (2023) to quantify the failure of Widening measures (~8% funding share) is effective and grounding.\n- **Conceptual Clarity**: The distinction between \"poverty\" and \"institutional thinness\" (via Rodriguez-Pose) is well-handled.\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n- **Citation Relevance (Critical)**: \n    - @Research_and_Te_Sheikh_2021 is used to define RTOs as \"super-intermediaries\" in the *European* context, but the paper is a case study on **Tanzania**. This is methodologically weak when substantial literature on European RTOs exists (e.g., EARTO reports, Arnold et al., Hales et al.).\n    - @Shaping_the_fut_Ellmei_2025 is cited to support \"Mandated Regional Partnerships\" for RTOs generally. This paper is a manifesto from the **Biomedical Alliance** regarding *health* research. Using it to propose a general FP10 mechanism for all RTOs is a scope error unless qualified (e.g., \"as proposed in the health sector...\").\n- **Missing Citations**: The \"Heitor Group\" is referenced as a key authority for FP10 strategic shifts but is **not included in the bibliography**. This is a critical omission as it forms the basis of the \"Strategic Implications\" section.\n- **Attribution Precision**: The \"Cathedral in the Desert\" metaphor is attributed to @Left_behind_pl_Pike_2024. While Pike discusses \"left-behind places,\" this specific metaphor regarding industrial plants/RTOs in backward regions is a classic concept (often linked to Mezzogiorno development in the 70s/80s). Ensure Pike actually uses this metaphor in the cited text, or cite the original source.\n\n**RECOMMENDED PAPERS**:\nRECOMMEND SEARCH: \"EARTO RTO impact assessment Europe\" | Reason: To replace the Tanzania reference with EU-relevant RTO definitions.\nRECOMMEND SEARCH: \"Heitor Group Horizon Europe Interim Evaluation\" | Reason: To provide the missing citation for the \"Heitor Group\" claims.\nRECOMMEND DOI: 10.1080/00343404.2018.1502422 (Crescenzi et al.) | Reason: Provides stronger evidence on Smart Specialisation and R&D funds than the current general citations.\n\n**SPECIFIC EDITS**:\n\n**Section: Introduction**\n- **Issue**: Citation of @Research_and_Te_Sheikh_2021 for RTO definition.\n- **Suggestion**: Replace with a European-focused reference (e.g., *Research Policy* papers on Fraunhofer/TNO or EARTO position papers). The Tanzania context invalidates the \"super-intermediary\" claim for the EU ERA context.\n\n**Section: Strategic Implications for FP10**\n- **Issue**: \"The 'Heitor Group' ... have signaled...\"\n- **Suggestion**: Insert a proper citation. Likely: *Group of Experts on the Interim Evaluation of Horizon Europe (2024)*.\n- **Issue**: Citation of @Shaping_the_fut_Ellmei_2025 for general RTO \"twinning\".\n- **Suggestion**: Clarify that this is a *health-sector* recommendation that you are proposing be expanded, or find a general innovation policy paper that proposes this (e.g., recent JRC papers on Regional Innovation Valleys).\n\n**Section: The Failure of Horizon Europe (FP9) Instruments**\n- **Issue**: Claim that Widening instruments are \"too small in scale.\"\n- **Suggestion**: While likely true, ensure @Horizon_Europe_Penalo_2024 specifically supports the *scale* argument. If not, add a reference to the European Court of Auditors or specific Widening evaluation reports.\n\n**Section: Typst Integrity**\n- **Issue**: Ensure the `#bibliography` call includes all referenced .bib files if you add new ones. (Current syntax is correct)."
