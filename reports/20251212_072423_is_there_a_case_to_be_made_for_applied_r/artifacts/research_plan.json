    "How is 'territorial fragility' currently defined and operationalized in EU cohesion policy and recent JRC literature?",
    "What specific mission-oriented or challenge-based mechanisms in Horizon Europe (FP9) have successfully engaged RTOs in place-based interventions, and how might these evolve in FP10?",
    "What empirical evidence links the presence and activity of RTOs to increased resilience in 'left-behind' or fragile European regions?",
    "How do current FP10 positioning papers and high-level group reports (e.g., Heitor Group) characterize the role of RTOs in bridging the innovation divide?",
    "What are the barriers preventing RTOs from effectively serving peripheral regions compared to central innovation hubs?"
